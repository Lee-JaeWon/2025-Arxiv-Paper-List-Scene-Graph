1,ROLO-SLAM: Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only SLAM in Uneven Terrain with Ground Vehicle,"Yinchuan Wang,Bin Ren,Xiang Zhang,Pengyu Wang,Chaoqun Wang,Rui Song,Yibin Li,Max Q. -H. Meng","LiDAR-based SLAM is recognized as one effective method to offer localization guidance in rough environments. However, off-the-shelf LiDAR-based SLAM methods suffer from significant pose estimation drifts, particularly components relevant to the vertical direction, when passing to uneven terrains. This deficiency typically leads to a conspicuously distorted global map. In this article, a LiDAR-based SLAM method is presented to improve the accuracy of pose estimations for ground vehicles in rough terrains, which is termed Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only (ROLO) SLAM. The method exploits a forward location prediction to coarsely eliminate the location difference of consecutive scans, thereby enabling separate and accurate determination of the location and orientation at the front-end. Furthermore, we adopt a parallel-capable spatial voxelization for correspondence-matching. We develop a spherical alignment-guided rotation registration within each voxel to estimate the rotation of vehicle. By incorporating geometric alignment, we introduce the motion constraint into the optimization formulation to enhance the rapid and effective estimation of LiDAR's translation. Subsequently, we extract several keyframes to construct the submap and exploit an alignment from the current scan to the submap for precise pose estimation. Meanwhile, a global-scale factor graph is established to aid in the reduction of cumulative errors. In various scenes, diverse experiments have been conducted to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate that ROLO-SLAM excels in pose estimation of ground vehicles and outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM frameworks.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02166,https://doi.org/10.1002/rob.22505
2,Exploiting Information Theory for Intuitive Robot Programming of Manual Activities,"Elena Merlo,Marta Lagomarsino,Edoardo Lamon,Arash Ajoudani","Observational learning is a promising approach to enable people without expertise in programming to transfer skills to robots in a user-friendly manner, since it mirrors how humans learn new behaviors by observing others. Many existing methods focus on instructing robots to mimic human trajectories, but motion-level strategies often pose challenges in skills generalization across diverse environments. This paper proposes a novel framework that allows robots to achieve a higher-level understanding of human-demonstrated manual tasks recorded in RGB videos. By recognizing the task structure and goals, robots generalize what observed to unseen scenarios. We found our task representation on Shannon's Information Theory (IT), which is applied for the first time to manual tasks. IT helps extract the active scene elements and quantify the information shared between hands and objects. We exploit scene graph properties to encode the extracted interaction features in a compact structure and segment the demonstration into blocks, streamlining the generation of Behavior Trees for robot replicas. Experiments validated the effectiveness of IT to automatically generate robot execution plans from a single human demonstration. Additionally, we provide HANDSOME, an open-source dataset of HAND Skills demOnstrated by Multi-subjEcts, to promote further research and evaluation in this field.",October 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23963,
3,Graph-Based Multimodal and Multi-view Alignment for Keystep Recognition,"Julia Lee Romero,Kyle Min,Subarna Tripathi,Morteza Karimzadeh","Egocentric videos capture scenes from a wearer's viewpoint, resulting in dynamic backgrounds, frequent motion, and occlusions, posing challenges to accurate keystep recognition. We propose a flexible graph-learning framework for fine-grained keystep recognition that is able to effectively leverage long-term dependencies in egocentric videos, and leverage alignment between egocentric and exocentric videos during training for improved inference on egocentric videos. Our approach consists of constructing a graph where each video clip of the egocentric video corresponds to a node. During training, we consider each clip of each exocentric video (if available) as additional nodes. We examine several strategies to define connections across these nodes and pose keystep recognition as a node classification task on the constructed graphs. We perform extensive experiments on the Ego-Exo4D dataset and show that our proposed flexible graph-based framework notably outperforms existing methods by more than 12 points in accuracy. Furthermore, the constructed graphs are sparse and compute efficient. We also present a study examining on harnessing several multimodal features, including narrations, depth, and object class labels, on a heterogeneous graph and discuss their corresponding contribution to the keystep recognition performance.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04121,
4,OpenIN: Open-Vocabulary Instance-Oriented Navigation in Dynamic Domestic Environments,"Yujie Tang,Meiling Wang,Yinan Deng,Zibo Zheng,Jingchuan Deng,Yufeng Yue","In daily domestic settings, frequently used objects like cups often have unfixed positions and multiple instances within the same category, and their carriers frequently change as well. As a result, it becomes challenging for a robot to efficiently navigate to a specific instance. To tackle this challenge, the robot must capture and update scene changes and plans continuously. However, current object navigation approaches primarily focus on the semantic level and lack the ability to dynamically update scene representation. In contrast, this paper captures the relationships between frequently used objects and their static carriers. It constructs an open-vocabulary Carrier-Relationship Scene Graph (CRSG) and updates the carrying status during robot navigation to reflect the dynamic changes of the scene. Based on the CRSG, we further propose an instance navigation strategy that models the navigation process as a Markov Decision Process. At each step, decisions are informed by the Large Language Model's commonsense knowledge and visual-language feature similarity. We designed a series of long-sequence navigation tasks for frequently used everyday items in the Habitat simulator. The results demonstrate that by updating the CRSG, the robot can efficiently navigate to moved targets. Additionally, we deployed our algorithm on a real robot and validated its practical effectiveness.

5,FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs,"Gabrielle Littlefair,Niladri Shekhar Dutt,Niloy J. Mitra","Interior design involves the careful selection and arrangement of objects to create an aesthetically pleasing, functional, and harmonized space that aligns with the client's design brief. This task is particularly challenging, as a successful design must not only incorporate all the necessary objects in a cohesive style, but also ensure they are arranged in a way that maximizes accessibility, while adhering to a variety of affordability and usage considerations. Data-driven solutions have been proposed, but these are typically room- or domain-specific and lack explainability in their design design considerations used in producing the final layout. In this paper, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be directly utilized for interior design. While we find that LLMs are not yet capable of generating complete layouts, they can be effectively leveraged in a structured manner, inspired by the workflow of interior designers. By systematically probing LLMs, we can reliably generate a list of objects along with relevant constraints that guide their placement. We translate this information into a design layout graph, which is then solved using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization setup to generate the final layouts. We benchmark our algorithm in various design configurations against existing LLM-based methods and human designs, and evaluate the results using a variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics along with user studies. In summary, we demonstrate that LLMs, when used in a structured manner, can effectively generate diverse high-quality layouts, making them a viable solution for creating large-scale virtual scenes.

6,Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Scene Graphs for Traffic Accident Understanding,"Aaron Lohner,Francesco Compagno,Jonathan Francis,Alessandro Oltramari","Recognizing a traffic accident is an essential part of any autonomous driving or road monitoring system. An accident can appear in a wide variety of forms, and understanding what type of accident is taking place may be useful to prevent it from recurring. This work focuses on classifying traffic scenes into specific accident types. We approach the problem by representing a traffic scene as a graph, where objects such as cars can be represented as nodes, and relative distances and directions between them as edges. This representation of a traffic scene is referred to as a scene graph, and can be used as input for an accident classifier. Better results are obtained with a classifier that fuses the scene graph input with visual and textual representations. This work introduces a multi-stage, multimodal pipeline that pre-processes videos of traffic accidents, encodes them as scene graphs, and aligns this representation with vision and language modalities before executing the classification task. When trained on 4 classes, our method achieves a balanced accuracy score of 57.77% on an (unbalanced) subset of the popular Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) benchmark, representing an increase of close to 5 percentage points from the case where scene graph information is not taken into account.",July 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05910,
7,UniQ: Unified Decoder with Task-specific Queries for Efficient Scene Graph Generation,"Xinyao Liao,Wei Wei,Dangyang Chen,Yuanyuan Fu","Scene Graph Generation(SGG) is a scene understanding task that aims at identifying object entities and reasoning their relationships within a given image. In contrast to prevailing two-stage methods based on a large object detector (e.g., Faster R-CNN), one-stage methods integrate a fixed-size set of learnable queries to jointly reason relational triplets <subject, predicate, object>. This paradigm demonstrates robust performance with significantly reduced parameters and computational overhead. However, the challenge in one-stage methods stems from the issue of weak entanglement, wherein entities involved in relationships require both coupled features shared within triplets and decoupled visual features. Previous methods either adopt a single decoder for coupled triplet feature modeling or multiple decoders for separate visual feature extraction but fail to consider both. In this paper, we introduce UniQ, a Unified decoder with task-specific Queries architecture, where task-specific queries generate decoupled visual features for subjects, objects, and predicates respectively, and unified decoder enables coupled feature modeling within relational triplets. Experimental results on the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate that UniQ has superior performance to both one-stage and two-stage methods.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05687,
8,Hierarchical Superpixel Segmentation via Structural Information Theory,"Minhui Xie,Hao Peng,Pu Li,Guangjie Zeng,Shuhai Wang,Jia Wu,Peng Li,Philip S. Yu","Superpixel segmentation is a foundation for many higher-level computer vision tasks, such as image segmentation, object recognition, and scene understanding. Existing graph-based superpixel segmentation methods typically concentrate on the relationships between a given pixel and its directly adjacent pixels while overlooking the influence of non-adjacent pixels. These approaches do not fully leverage the global information in the graph, leading to suboptimal segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we present SIT-HSS, a hierarchical superpixel segmentation method based on structural information theory. Specifically, we first design a novel graph construction strategy that incrementally explores the pixel neighborhood to add edges based on 1-dimensional structural entropy (1D SE). This strategy maximizes the retention of graph information while avoiding an overly complex graph structure. Then, we design a new 2D SE-guided hierarchical graph partitioning method, which iteratively merges pixel clusters layer by layer to reduce the graph's 2D SE until a predefined segmentation scale is achieved. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the SIT-HSS performs better than state-of-the-art unsupervised superpixel segmentation algorithms.

9,TimeLogic: A Temporal Logic Benchmark for Video QA,"Sirnam Swetha,Hilde Kuehne,Mubarak Shah","Temporal logical understanding, a core facet of human cognition, plays a pivotal role in capturing complex sequential events and their temporal relationships within videos. This capability is particularly crucial in tasks like Video Question Answering (VideoQA), where the goal is to process visual data over time together with textual data to provide coherent answers. However, current VideoQA benchmarks devote little focus to evaluating this critical skill due to the challenge of annotating temporal logic. Despite the advancement of vision-language models, assessing their temporal logical reasoning powers remains a challenge, primarily due to the lack QA pairs that demand formal, complex temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the TimeLogic QA (TLQA) framework to automatically generate the QA pairs, specifically designed to evaluate the temporal logical understanding. To this end, TLQA leverages temporal annotations from existing video datasets together with temporal operators derived from logic theory to construct questions that test understanding of event sequences and their temporal relationships. TLQA framework is generic and scalable, capable of leveraging both, existing video action datasets with temporal action segmentation annotations, or video datasets with temporal scene graph annotations, to automatically generate temporal logical questions. We leverage 4 datasets, STAR, Breakfast, AGQA, and CrossTask, and generate two VideoQA dataset variants - small (TLQA-S) and large (TLQA-L) - containing 2k and 10k QA pairs for each category, resulting in 32k and 160k total pairs per dataset. We undertake a comprehensive evaluation of leading-edge VideoQA models, employing the TLQA to benchmark their temporal logical understanding capabilities. We assess the VideoQA model's temporal reasoning performance on 16 categories of temporal logic with varying temporal complexity.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07214,
10,Situational Scene Graph for Structured Human-centric Situation Understanding,"Chinthani Sugandhika,Chen Li,Deepu Rajan,Basura Fernando","Graph based representation has been widely used in modelling spatio-temporal relationships in video understanding. Although effective, existing graph-based approaches focus on capturing the human-object relationships while ignoring fine-grained semantic properties of the action components. These semantic properties are crucial for understanding the current situation, such as where does the action takes place, what tools are used and functional properties of the objects. In this work, we propose a graph-based representation called Situational Scene Graph (SSG) to encode both human-object relationships and the corresponding semantic properties. The semantic details are represented as predefined roles and values inspired by situation frame, which is originally designed to represent a single action. Based on our proposed representation, we introduce the task of situational scene graph generation and propose a multi-stage pipeline Interactive and Complementary Network (InComNet) to address the task. Given that the existing datasets are not applicable to the task, we further introduce a SSG dataset whose annotations consist of semantic role-value frames for human, objects and verb predicates of human-object relations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SSG representation by testing on different downstream tasks. Experimental results show that the unified representation can not only benefit predicate classification and semantic role-value classification, but also benefit reasoning tasks on human-centric situation understanding. We will release the code and the dataset soon.",October 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22829,
11,Generative Visual Commonsense Answering and Explaining with Generative Scene Graph Constructing,"Fan Yuan,Xiaoyuan Fang,Rong Quan,Jing Li,Wei Bi,Xiaogang Xu,Piji Li","Visual Commonsense Reasoning, which is regarded as one challenging task to pursue advanced visual scene comprehension, has been used to diagnose the reasoning ability of AI systems. However, reliable reasoning requires a good grasp of the scene's details. Existing work fails to effectively exploit the real-world object relationship information present within the scene, and instead overly relies on knowledge from training memory. Based on these observations, we propose a novel scene-graph-enhanced visual commonsense reasoning generation method named \\textit{\\textbf{G2}}, which first utilizes the image patches and LLMs to construct a location-free scene graph, and then answer and explain based on the scene graph's information. We also propose automatic scene graph filtering and selection strategies to absorb valuable scene graph information during training. Extensive experiments are conducted on the tasks and datasets of scene graph constructing and visual commonsense answering and explaining, respectively. Experimental results and ablation analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09041,
12,GOTLoc: General Outdoor Text-based Localization Using Scene Graph Retrieval with OpenStreetMap,"Donghwi Jung,Keonwoo Kim,Seong-Woo Kim","We propose GOTLoc, a robust localization method capable of operating even in outdoor environments where GPS signals are unavailable. The method achieves this robust localization by leveraging comparisons between scene graphs generated from text descriptions and maps. Existing text-based localization studies typically represent maps as point clouds and identify the most similar scenes by comparing embeddings of text and point cloud data. However, point cloud maps have limited scalability as it is impractical to pre-generate maps for all outdoor spaces. Furthermore, their large data size makes it challenging to store and utilize them directly on actual robots. To address these issues, GOTLoc leverages compact data structures, such as scene graphs, to store spatial information, enabling individual robots to carry and utilize large amounts of map data. Additionally, by utilizing publicly available map data, such as OpenStreetMap, which provides global information on outdoor spaces, we eliminate the need for additional effort to create custom map data. For performance evaluation, we utilized the KITTI360Pose dataset in conjunction with corresponding OpenStreetMap data to compare the proposed method with existing approaches. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to algorithms relying on point cloud maps. Moreover, in city-scale tests, GOTLoc required significantly less storage compared to point cloud-based methods and completed overall processing within a few seconds, validating its applicability to real-world robotics. Our code is available at https://github.com/donghwijung/GOTLoc.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08575,
13,DriveLM: Driving with Graph Visual Question Answering,"Chonghao Sima,Katrin Renz,Kashyap Chitta,Li Chen,Hanxue Zhang,Chengen Xie,Jens Bei\xc3\x9fwenger,Ping Luo,Andreas Geiger,Hongyang Li","We study how vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data can be integrated into end-to-end driving systems to boost generalization and enable interactivity with human users. While recent approaches adapt VLMs to driving via single-round visual question answering (VQA), human drivers reason about decisions in multiple steps. Starting from the localization of key objects, humans estimate object interactions before taking actions. The key insight is that with our proposed task, Graph VQA, where we model graph-structured reasoning through perception, prediction and planning question-answer pairs, we obtain a suitable proxy task to mimic the human reasoning process. We instantiate datasets (DriveLM-Data) built upon nuScenes and CARLA, and propose a VLM-based baseline approach (DriveLM-Agent) for jointly performing Graph VQA and end-to-end driving. The experiments demonstrate that Graph VQA provides a simple, principled framework for reasoning about a driving scene, and DriveLM-Data provides a challenging benchmark for this task. Our DriveLM-Agent baseline performs end-to-end autonomous driving competitively in comparison to state-of-the-art driving-specific architectures. Notably, its benefits are pronounced when it is evaluated zero-shot on unseen objects or sensor configurations. We hope this work can be the starting point to shed new light on how to apply VLMs for autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, all code, data, and models are available to the public.",December 2023.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14150,
14,ComplexVAD: Detecting Interaction Anomalies in Video,"Furkan Mumcu,Michael J. Jones,Yasin Yilmaz,Anoop Cherian","Existing video anomaly detection datasets are inadequate for representing complex anomalies that occur due to the interactions between objects. The absence of complex anomalies in previous video anomaly detection datasets affects research by shifting the focus onto simple anomalies. To address this problem, we introduce a new large-scale dataset: ComplexVAD. In addition, we propose a novel method to detect complex anomalies via modeling the interactions between objects using a scene graph with spatio-temporal attributes. With our proposed method and two other state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods, we obtain baseline scores on ComplexVAD and demonstrate that our new method outperforms existing works.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09733,
15,ASTRA: A Scene-aware TRAnsformer-based model for trajectory prediction,"Izzeddin Teeti,Aniket Thomas,Munish Monga,Sachin Kumar,Uddeshya Singh,Andrew Bradley,Biplab Banerjee,Fabio Cuzzolin","We present ASTRA (A} Scene-aware TRAnsformer-based model for trajectory prediction), a light-weight pedestrian trajectory forecasting model that integrates the scene context, spatial dynamics, social inter-agent interactions and temporal progressions for precise forecasting. We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09878,
16,DDS: Decoupled Dynamic Scene-Graph Generation Network,"A S M Iftekhar,Raphael Ruschel,Satish Kumar,Suya You,B. S. Manjunath","Scene-graph generation involves creating a structural representation of the relationships between objects in a scene by predicting subject-object-relation triplets from input data. Existing methods show poor performance in detecting triplets outside of a predefined set, primarily due to their reliance on dependent feature learning. To address this issue, we propose DDS -- a decoupled dynamic scene-graph generation network -- that consists of two independent branches that can disentangle extracted features. The key innovation of the current paper is the decoupling of the features representing the relationships from those of the objects, which enables the detection of novel object-relationship combinations. The DDS model is evaluated on three datasets and outperforms previous methods by a significant margin, especially in detecting previously unseen triplets.",January 2023.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07666,
17,Location-Free Scene Graph Generation,"Ege \xc3\x96zsoy,Felix Holm,Mahdi Saleh,Tobias Czempiel,Chantal Pellegrini,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam","Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a visual understanding task, aiming to describe a scene as a graph of entities and their relationships with each other. Existing works rely on location labels in form of bounding boxes or segmentation masks, increasing annotation costs and limiting dataset expansion. Recognizing that many applications do not require location data, we break this dependency and introduce location-free scene graph generation (LF-SGG). This new task aims at predicting instances of entities, as well as their relationships, without the explicit calculation of their spatial localization. To objectively evaluate the task, the predicted and ground truth scene graphs need to be compared. We solve this NP-hard problem through an efficient branching algorithm. Additionally, we design the first LF-SGG method, Pix2SG, using autoregressive sequence modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three scene graph generation datasets as well as two downstream tasks, image retrieval and visual question answering, and show that our approach is competitive to existing methods while not relying on location cues.",March 2023.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10944,
18,Inferring Past Human Actions in Homes with Abductive Reasoning,"Clement Tan,Chai Kiat Yeo,Cheston Tan,Basura Fernando","Abductive reasoning aims to make the most likely inference for a given set of incomplete observations. In this paper, we introduce ""Abductive Past Action Inference"", a novel research task aimed at identifying the past actions performed by individuals within homes to reach specific states captured in a single image, using abductive inference. The research explores three key abductive inference problems: past action set prediction, past action sequence prediction, and abductive past action verification. We introduce several models tailored for abductive past action inference, including a relational graph neural network, a relational bilinear pooling model, and a relational transformer model. Notably, the newly proposed object-relational bilinear graph encoder-decoder (BiGED) model emerges as the most effective among all methods evaluated, demonstrating good proficiency in handling the intricacies of the Action Genome dataset. The contributions of this research significantly advance the ability of deep learning models to reason about current scene evidence and make highly plausible inferences about past human actions. This advancement enables a deeper understanding of events and behaviors, which can enhance decision-making and improve system capabilities across various real-world applications such as Human-Robot Interaction and Elderly Care and Health Monitoring.

19,Predicate Debiasing in Vision-Language Models Integration for Scene Graph Generation Enhancement,"Yuxuan Wang,Xiaoyuan Liu","Scene Graph Generation (SGG) provides basic language representation of visual scenes, requiring models to grasp complex and diverse semantics between objects. This complexity and diversity in SGG leads to underrepresentation, where parts of triplet labels are rare or even unseen during training, resulting in imprecise predictions. To tackle this, we propose integrating the pretrained Vision-language Models to enhance representation. However, due to the gap between pretraining and SGG, direct inference of pretrained VLMs on SGG leads to severe bias, which stems from the imbalanced predicates distribution in the pretraining language set. To alleviate the bias, we introduce a novel LM Estimation to approximate the unattainable predicates distribution. Finally, we ensemble the debiased VLMs with SGG models to enhance the representation, where we design a certainty-aware indicator to score each sample and dynamically adjust the ensemble weights. Our training-free method effectively addresses the predicates bias in pretrained VLMs, enhances SGG's representation, and significantly improve the performance.",March 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16184,
20,Machine Learning Modeling for Multi-order Human Visual Motion Processing,"Zitang Sun,Yen-Ju Chen,Yung-Hao Yang,Yuan Li,Shin'ya Nishida","Our research aims to develop machines that learn to perceive visual motion as do humans. While recent advances in computer vision (CV) have enabled DNN-based models to accurately estimate optical flow in naturalistic images, a significant disparity remains between CV models and the biological visual system in both architecture and behavior. This disparity includes humans' ability to perceive the motion of higher-order image features (second-order motion), which many CV models fail to capture because of their reliance on the intensity conservation law. Our model architecture mimics the cortical V1-MT motion processing pathway, utilizing a trainable motion energy sensor bank and a recurrent graph network. Supervised learning employing diverse naturalistic videos allows the model to replicate psychophysical and physiological findings about first-order (luminance-based) motion perception. For second-order motion, inspired by neuroscientific findings, the model includes an additional sensing pathway with nonlinear preprocessing before motion energy sensing, implemented using a simple multilayer 3D CNN block. When exploring how the brain acquired the ability to perceive second-order motion in natural environments, in which pure second-order signals are rare, we hypothesized that second-order mechanisms were critical when estimating robust object motion amidst optical fluctuations, such as highlights on glossy surfaces. We trained our dual-pathway model on novel motion datasets with varying material properties of moving objects. We found that training to estimate object motion from non-Lambertian materials naturally endowed the model with the capacity to perceive second-order motion, as can humans. The resulting model effectively aligns with biological systems while generalizing to both first- and second-order motion phenomena in natural scenes.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12810,
21,Graph Optimality-Aware Stochastic LiDAR Bundle Adjustment with Progressive Spatial Smoothing,"Jianping Li,Thien-Minh Nguyen,Muqing Cao,Shenghai Yuan,Tzu-Yi Hung,Lihua Xie","Large-scale LiDAR Bundle Adjustment (LBA) to refine sensor orientation and point cloud accuracy simultaneously to build the navigation map is a fundamental task in logistics and robotics. Unlike pose-graph-based methods that rely solely on pairwise relationships between LiDAR frames, LBA leverages raw LiDAR correspondences to achieve more precise results, especially when initial pose estimates are unreliable for low-cost sensors. However, existing LBA methods face challenges such as simplistic planar correspondences, extensive observations, and dense normal matrices in the least-squares problem, which limit robustness, efficiency, and scalability. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization scheme with Progressive Spatial Smoothing, namely PSS-GOSO, to achieve \\textit{robust}, \\textit{efficient}, and \\textit{scalable} LBA. The Progressive Spatial Smoothing (PSS) module extracts \\textit{robust} LiDAR feature association exploiting the prior structure information obtained by the polynomial smooth kernel. The Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization (GOSO) module first sparsifies the graph according to optimality for an \\textit{efficient} optimization. GOSO then utilizes stochastic clustering and graph marginalization to solve the large-scale state estimation problem for a \\textit{scalable} LBA. We validate PSS-GOSO across diverse scenes captured by various platforms, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the resulting point cloud maps are used for automatic last-mile delivery in large-scale complex scenes.

Existing robotic exploration approaches via active interaction are often restricted to tabletop scenes, neglecting the unique challenges posed by mobile exploration, such as large exploration spaces, complex action spaces, and diverse object relations. In this work, we introduce a 3D relational object graph that encodes diverse object relations and enables exploration through active interaction. We develop a system based on this representation and evaluate it across diverse scenes. Our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the system's effectiveness and generalization capabilities, outperforming methods that rely solely on vision-language models (VLMs).",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13338,
23,Resource Allocation Driven by Large Models in Future Semantic-Aware Networks,"Haijun Zhang,Jiaxin Ni,Zijun Wu,Xiangnan Liu,V. C. M. Leung","Large model has emerged as a key enabler for the popularity of future networked intelligent applications. However, the surge of data traffic brought by intelligent applications puts pressure on the resource utilization and energy consumption of the future networks. With efficient content understanding capabilities, semantic communication holds significant potential for reducing data transmission in intelligent applications. In this article, resource allocation driven by large models in semantic-aware networks is investigated. Specifically, a semantic-aware communication network architecture based on scene graph models and multimodal pre-trained models is designed to achieve efficient data transmission. On the basis of the proposed network architecture, an intelligent resource allocation scheme in semantic-aware network is proposed to further enhance resource utilization efficiency. In the resource allocation scheme, the semantic transmission quality is adopted as an evaluation metric and the impact of wireless channel fading on semantic transmission is analyzed. To maximize the semantic transmission quality for multiple users, a diffusion model-based decision-making scheme is designed to address the power allocation problem in semantic-aware networks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed large-model-driven network architecture and resource allocation scheme achieve high-quality semantic transmission.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14832,
24,VARFVV: View-Adaptive Real-Time Interactive Free-View Video Streaming with Edge Computing,"Qiang Hu,Qihan He,Houqiang Zhong,Guo Lu,Xiaoyun Zhang,Guangtao Zhai,Yanfeng Wang","Free-view video (FVV) allows users to explore immersive video content from multiple views. However, delivering FVV poses significant challenges due to the uncertainty in view switching, combined with the substantial bandwidth and computational resources required to transmit and decode multiple video streams, which may result in frequent playback interruptions. Existing approaches, either client-based or cloud-based, struggle to meet high Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements under limited bandwidth and computational resources. To address these issues, we propose VARFVV, a bandwidth- and computationally-efficient system that enables real-time interactive FVV streaming with high QoE and low switching delay. Specifically, VARFVV introduces a low-complexity FVV generation scheme that reassembles multiview video frames at the edge server based on user-selected view tracks, eliminating the need for transcoding and significantly reducing computational overhead. This design makes it well-suited for large-scale, mobile-based UHD FVV experiences. Furthermore, we present a popularity-adaptive bit allocation method, leveraging a graph neural network, that predicts view popularity and dynamically adjusts bit allocation to maximize QoE within bandwidth constraints. We also construct an FVV dataset comprising 330 videos from 10 scenes, including basketball, opera, etc. Extensive experiments show that VARFVV surpasses existing methods in video quality, switching latency, computational efficiency, and bandwidth usage, supporting over 500 users on a single edge server with a switching delay of 71.5ms.

While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13848,
26,StreamingRAG: Real-time Contextual Retrieval and Generation Framework,"Murugan Sankaradas,Ravi K. Rajendran,Srimat T. Chakradhar","Extracting real-time insights from multi-modal data streams from various domains such as healthcare, intelligent transportation, and satellite remote sensing remains a challenge. High computational demands and limited knowledge scope restrict the applicability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) on these data streams. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address knowledge limitations of these models, but suffer from slow preprocessing, making them unsuitable for real-time analysis. We propose StreamingRAG, a novel RAG framework designed for streaming data. StreamingRAG constructs evolving knowledge graphs capturing scene-object-entity relationships in real-time. The knowledge graph achieves temporal-aware scene representations using MM-LLMs and enables timely responses for specific events or user queries. StreamingRAG addresses limitations in existing methods, achieving significant improvements in real-time analysis (5-6x faster throughput), contextual accuracy (through a temporal knowledge graph), and reduced resource consumption (using lightweight models by 2-3x).",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14101,
27,Scene Understanding Enabled Semantic Communication with Open Channel Coding,"Zhe Xiang,Fei Yu,Quan Deng,Yuandi Li,Zhiguo Wan","As communication systems transition from symbol transmission to conveying meaningful information, sixth-generation (6G) networks emphasize semantic communication. This approach prioritizes high-level semantic information, improving robustness and reducing redundancy across modalities like text, speech, and images. However, traditional semantic communication faces limitations, including static coding strategies, poor generalization, and reliance on task-specific knowledge bases that hinder adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel system combining scene understanding, Large Language Models (LLMs), and open channel coding, named \\textbf{OpenSC}. Traditional systems rely on fixed domain-specific knowledge bases, limiting their ability to generalize. Our open channel coding approach leverages shared, publicly available knowledge, enabling flexible, adaptive encoding. This dynamic system reduces reliance on static task-specific data, enhancing adaptability across diverse tasks and environments. Additionally, we use scene graphs for structured semantic encoding, capturing object relationships and context to improve tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). Our approach selectively encodes key semantic elements, minimizing redundancy and improving transmission efficiency. Experimental results show significant improvements in both semantic understanding and efficiency, advancing the potential of adaptive, generalizable semantic communication in 6G networks.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14520,

Unlike existing SfM solutions that rely on costly matching and global optimization to achieve accurate 3D reconstructions, Light3R-SfM addresses this limitation through a novel latent global alignment module. This module replaces traditional global optimization with a learnable attention mechanism, effectively capturing multi-view constraints across images for robust and precise camera pose estimation. Light3R-SfM constructs a sparse scene graph via retrieval-score-guided shortest path tree to dramatically reduce memory usage and computational overhead compared to the naive approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light3R-SfM achieves competitive accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, making it ideal for 3D reconstruction tasks in real-world applications with a runtime constraint. This work pioneers a data-driven, feed-forward SfM approach, paving the way toward scalable, accurate, and efficient 3D reconstruction in the wild.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14914,

Specifically, we introduce a novel method to uplift 2D image features into Gaussian Splatting representations of 3D scenes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on minimizing a reconstruction loss, our method employs a simpler and more efficient feature aggregation technique, augmented by a graph diffusion mechanism. Graph diffusion refines 3D features, such as coarse segmentation masks, by leveraging 3D geometry and pairwise similarities induced by DINOv2. Our approach achieves performance comparable to the state of the art on multiple downstream tasks while delivering significant speed-ups. Notably, we obtain competitive segmentation results using generic DINOv2 features, despite DINOv2 not being trained on millions of annotated segmentation masks like SAM. When applied to CLIP features, our method demonstrates strong performance in open-vocabulary object localization tasks, highlighting the versatility of our approach.",October 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14462,
30,General Scene Adaptation for Vision-and-Language Navigation,"Haodong Hong,Yanyuan Qiao,Sen Wang,Jiajun Liu,Qi Wu","Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks mainly evaluate agents based on one-time execution of individual instructions across multiple environments, aiming to develop agents capable of functioning in any environment in a zero-shot manner. However, real-world navigation robots often operate in persistent environments with relatively consistent physical layouts, visual observations, and language styles from instructors. Such a gap in the task setting presents an opportunity to improve VLN agents by incorporating continuous adaptation to specific environments. To better reflect these real-world conditions, we introduce GSA-VLN, a novel task requiring agents to execute navigation instructions within a specific scene and simultaneously adapt to it for improved performance over time. To evaluate the proposed task, one has to address two challenges in existing VLN datasets: the lack of OOD data, and the limited number and style diversity of instructions for each scene. Therefore, we propose a new dataset, GSA-R2R, which significantly expands the diversity and quantity of environments and instructions for the R2R dataset to evaluate agent adaptability in both ID and OOD contexts. Furthermore, we design a three-stage instruction orchestration pipeline that leverages LLMs to refine speaker-generated instructions and apply role-playing techniques to rephrase instructions into different speaking styles. This is motivated by the observation that each individual user often has consistent signatures or preferences in their instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on GSA-R2R to thoroughly evaluate our dataset and benchmark various methods. Based on our findings, we propose a novel method, GR-DUET, which incorporates memory-based navigation graphs with an environment-specific training strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on all GSA-R2R splits.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17403,

This is because of their inability to recognize their limited understanding of the user's physical context. We present SituationalLLM, a novel approach that integrates structured scene information into an LLM to deliver proactive, context-aware assistance. By encoding objects, attributes, and relationships in a custom Scene Graph Language, SituationalLLM actively identifies gaps in environmental context and seeks clarifications during user interactions. This behavior emerges from training on the Situational Awareness Database for Instruct-Tuning (SAD-Instruct), which combines diverse, scenario-specific scene graphs with iterative, dialogue-based refinements. Experimental results indicate that SituationalLLM outperforms generic LLM baselines in task specificity, reliability, and adaptability, paving the way for environment-aware AI assistants capable of delivering robust, user-centric guidance under real-world constraints.",June 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13302,https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.18551.1
32,PhiP-G: Physics-Guided Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation,"Qixuan Li,Chao Wang,Zongjin He,Yan Peng","Text-to-3D asset generation has achieved significant optimization under the supervision of 2D diffusion priors. However, when dealing with compositional scenes, existing methods encounter several challenges: 1). failure to ensure that composite scene layouts comply with physical laws; 2). difficulty in accurately capturing the assets and relationships described in complex scene descriptions; 3). limited autonomous asset generation capabilities among layout approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs). To avoid these compromises, we propose a novel framework for compositional scene generation, PhiP-G, which seamlessly integrates generation techniques with layout guidance based on a world model. Leveraging LLM-based agents, PhiP-G analyzes the complex scene description to generate a scene graph, and integrating a multimodal 2D generation agent and a 3D Gaussian generation method for targeted assets creation. For the stage of layout, PhiP-G employs a physical pool with adhesion capabilities and a visual supervision agent, forming a world model for layout prediction and planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhiP-G significantly enhances the generation quality and physical rationality of the compositional scenes. Notably, PhiP-G attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in CLIP scores, achieves parity with the leading methods in generation quality as measured by the T$^3$Bench, and improves efficiency by 24x.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00708,
33,Improving Generalization Ability for 3D Object Detection by Learning Sparsity-invariant Features,"Hsin-Cheng Lu,Chung-Yi Lin,Winston H. Hsu","In autonomous driving, 3D object detection is essential for accurately identifying and tracking objects. Despite the continuous development of various technologies for this task, a significant drawback is observed in most of them-they experience substantial performance degradation when detecting objects in unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the generalization ability for 3D object detection on a single domain. We primarily focus on generalizing from a single source domain to target domains with distinct sensor configurations and scene distributions. To learn sparsity-invariant features from a single source domain, we selectively subsample the source data to a specific beam, using confidence scores determined by the current detector to identify the density that holds utmost importance for the detector. Subsequently, we employ the teacher-student framework to align the Bird's Eye View (BEV) features for different point clouds densities. We also utilize feature content alignment (FCA) and graph-based embedding relationship alignment (GERA) to instruct the detector to be domain-agnostic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to other baselines. Furthermore, our approach even outperforms certain domain adaptation methods that can access to the target domain data.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02322,
34,Functional 3D Scene Synthesis through Human-Scene Optimization,"Yao Wei,Matteo Toso,Pietro Morerio,Michael Ying Yang,Alessio Del Bue","This paper presents a novel generative approach that outputs 3D indoor environments solely from a textual description of the scene. Current methods often treat scene synthesis as a mere layout prediction task, leading to rooms with overlapping objects or overly structured scenes, with limited consideration of the practical usability of the generated environment. Instead, our approach is based on a simple, but effective principle: we condition scene synthesis to generate rooms that are usable by humans. This principle is implemented by synthesizing 3D humans that interact with the objects composing the scene. If this human-centric scene generation is viable, the room layout is functional and it leads to a more coherent 3D structure. To this end, we propose a novel method for functional 3D scene synthesis, which consists of reasoning, 3D assembling and optimization. We regard text guided 3D synthesis as a reasoning process by generating a scene graph via a graph diffusion network. Considering object functional co-occurrence, a new strategy is designed to better accommodate human-object interaction and avoidance, achieving human-aware 3D scene optimization. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method in generating coherent 3D scene synthesis results.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06819,
35,Mapping and Localization Using LiDAR Fiducial Markers,Yibo Liu,"LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous systems, yet LiDAR fiducial markers (LFMs) lag behind visual fiducial markers (VFMs) in adoption and utility. Bridging this gap is vital for robotics and computer vision but challenging due to the sparse, unstructured nature of 3D LiDAR data and 2D-focused fiducial marker designs. This dissertation proposes a novel framework for mapping and localization using LFMs is proposed to benefit a variety of real-world applications, including the collection of 3D assets and training data for point cloud registration, 3D map merging, Augmented Reality (AR), and many more.  First, an Intensity Image-based LiDAR Fiducial Marker (IFM) system is introduced, using thin, letter-sized markers compatible with VFMs. A detection method locates 3D fiducials from intensity images, enabling LiDAR pose estimation. Second, an enhanced algorithm extends detection to 3D maps, increasing marker range and facilitating tasks like 3D map merging. This method leverages both intensity and geometry, overcoming limitations of geometry-only detection approaches. Third, a new LFM-based mapping and localization method registers unordered, low-overlap point clouds. It employs adaptive threshold detection and a two-level graph framework to solve a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem, optimizing point cloud and marker poses. Additionally, the Livox-3DMatch dataset is introduced, improving learning-based multiview point cloud registration methods.  Extensive experiments with various LiDAR models in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03510,

In this work, we propose SG-RwR, a Schema-Guided Retrieve-while-Reason framework for reasoning and planning with scene graphs. Our approach employs two cooperative, code-writing LLM agents: a (1) Reasoner for task planning and information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever for extracting corresponding graph information following the queries. Two agents collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information. Unlike prior works, both agents are prompted only with the scene graph schema rather than the full graph data, which reduces the hallucination by limiting input tokens, and drives the Reasoner to generate reasoning trace abstractly.Following the trace, the Retriever programmatically query the scene graph data based on the schema understanding, allowing dynamic and global attention on the graph that enhances alignment between reasoning and retrieval. Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical Q\\&A and planning tasks, and can benefit from task-level few-shot examples, even in the absence of agent-level demonstrations.

However, its chaotic nature often hinders viewers from effectively assimilating the collective knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive science videos. With a formative study, we examined viewers' practices for processing collective knowledge and the specific barriers they encountered. Building on these insights, we designed a processing pipeline to filter, classify, and cluster danmaku, leading to the development of CoKnowledge - a tool incorporating a video abstract, knowledge graphs, and supplementary danmaku features to support viewers' assimilation of collective knowledge in science videos. A within-subject study (N=24) showed that CoKnowledge significantly enhanced participants' comprehension and recall of collective knowledge compared to a baseline with unprocessed live comments.

38,Taking A Closer Look at Interacting Objects: Interaction-Aware Open Vocabulary Scene Graph Generation,"Lin Li,Chuhan Zhang,Dong Zhang,Chong Sun,Chen Li,Long Chen","Today's open vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) extends traditional SGG by recognizing novel objects and relationships beyond predefined categories, leveraging the knowledge from pre-trained large-scale models. Most existing methods adopt a two-stage pipeline: weakly supervised pre-training with image captions and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on fully annotated scene graphs. Nonetheless, they omit explicit modeling of interacting objects and treat all objects equally, resulting in mismatched relation pairs. To this end, we propose an interaction-aware OVSGG framework INOVA. During pre-training, INOVA employs an interaction-aware target generation strategy to distinguish interacting objects from non-interacting ones. In SFT, INOVA devises an interaction-guided query selection tactic to prioritize interacting objects during bipartite graph matching. Besides, INOVA is equipped with an interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to enhance the robustness by pushing interacting object pairs away from the background. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks (VG and GQA) show that INOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-aware mechanisms for real-world applications.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03856,

However, these advancements primarily focus on vision, with limited attention given to using 3D modeling sensors, restricting a comprehensive understanding of objects in response to prompts containing qualitative and quantitative queries. Recently, as a promising automotive sensor with affordable cost, 4D millimeter-wave radars provide denser point clouds than conventional radars and perceive both semantic and physical characteristics of objects, thereby enhancing the reliability of perception systems. To foster the development of natural language-driven context understanding in radar scenes for 3D visual grounding, we construct the first dataset, Talk2Radar, which bridges these two modalities for 3D Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). Talk2Radar contains 8,682 referring prompt samples with 20,558 referred objects. Moreover, we propose a novel model, T-RadarNet, for 3D REC on point clouds, achieving State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance on the Talk2Radar dataset compared to counterparts.

Denoising Diffusion Models are a promising alternative for high-fidelity image synthesis, but existing state-of-the-art conditioning methods fall short in providing precise control or interactivity over the generated scenes.  We introduce SurGrID, a Scene Graph to Image Diffusion Model, allowing for controllable surgical scene synthesis by leveraging Scene Graphs. These graphs encode a surgical scene's components' spatial and semantic information, which are then translated into an intermediate representation using our novel pre-training step that explicitly captures local and global information.  Our proposed method improves the fidelity of generated images and their coherence with the graph input over the state-of-the-art. Further, we demonstrate the simulation's realism and controllability in a user assessment study involving clinical experts.

41,Embed Any NeRF: Graph Meta-Networks for Neural Tasks on Arbitrary NeRF Architectures,"Francesco Ballerini,Pierluigi Zama Ramirez,Samuele Salti,Luigi Di Stefano","Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm for representing 3D objects and scenes by encoding shape and appearance information into the weights of a neural network. Recent works have shown how such weights can be used as input to frameworks processing them to solve deep learning tasks. Yet, these frameworks can only process NeRFs with a specific, predefined architecture. In this paper, we present the first framework that can ingest NeRFs with multiple architectures and perform inference on architectures unseen at training time. We achieve this goal by training a Graph Meta-Network in a representation learning framework. Moreover, we show how a contrastive objective is conducive to obtaining an architecture-agnostic latent space. In experiments on both MLP-based and tri-planar NeRFs, our approach demonstrates robust performance in classification and retrieval tasks that either matches or exceeds that of existing frameworks constrained to single architectures, thus providing the first architecture-agnostic method to perform tasks on NeRFs by processing their weights.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09623,

Although effective for accurate visual odometry in complex scenarios, these methods discard crucial information about moving objects. By incorporating this information into a Dynamic SLAM framework, the motion of dynamic entities can be estimated, enhancing navigation whilst ensuring accurate localization. However, the fundamental formulation of Dynamic SLAM remains an open challenge, with no consensus on the optimal approach for accurate motion estimation within a SLAM pipeline. Therefore, we developed DynoSAM, an open-source framework for Dynamic SLAM that enables the efficient implementation, testing, and comparison of various Dynamic SLAM optimization formulations. DynoSAM integrates static and dynamic measurements into a unified optimization problem solved using factor graphs, simultaneously estimating camera poses, static scene, object motion or poses, and object structures. We evaluate DynoSAM across diverse simulated and real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art motion estimation in indoor and outdoor environments, with substantial improvements over existing systems.

43,SAM-LAD: Segment Anything Model Meets Zero-Shot Logic Anomaly Detection,"Yun Peng,Xiao Lin,Nachuan Ma,Jiayuan Du,Chuangwei Liu,Chengju Liu,Qijun Chen","Visual anomaly detection is vital in real-world applications, such as industrial defect detection and medical diagnosis. However, most existing methods focus on local structural anomalies and fail to detect higher-level functional anomalies under logical conditions. Although recent studies have explored logical anomaly detection, they can only address simple anomalies like missing or addition and show poor generalizability due to being heavily data-driven. To fill this gap, we propose SAM-LAD, a zero-shot, plug-and-play framework for logical anomaly detection in any scene. First, we obtain a query image's feature map using a pre-trained backbone. Simultaneously, we retrieve the reference images and their corresponding feature maps via the nearest neighbor search of the query image. Then, we introduce the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain object masks of the query and reference images. Each object mask is multiplied with the entire image's feature map to obtain object feature maps. Next, an Object Matching Model (OMM) is proposed to match objects in the query and reference images. To facilitate object matching, we further propose a Dynamic Channel Graph Attention (DCGA) module, treating each object as a keypoint and converting its feature maps into feature vectors. Finally, based on the object matching relations, an Anomaly Measurement Model (AMM) is proposed to detect objects with logical anomalies. Structural anomalies in the objects can also be detected. We validate our proposed SAM-LAD using various benchmarks, including industrial datasets (MVTec Loco AD, MVTec AD), and the logical dataset (DigitAnatomy).

Current methods often struggle with domain-specific limitations or low-quality object generation. To address these, we propose CAST (Component-Aligned 3D Scene Reconstruction from a Single RGB Image), a novel method for 3D scene reconstruction and recovery. CAST starts by extracting object-level 2D segmentation and relative depth information from the input image, followed by using a GPT-based model to analyze inter-object spatial relationships. This enables the understanding of how objects relate to each other within the scene, ensuring more coherent reconstruction. CAST then employs an occlusion-aware large-scale 3D generation model to independently generate each object's full geometry, using MAE and point cloud conditioning to mitigate the effects of occlusions and partial object information, ensuring accurate alignment with the source image's geometry and texture. To align each object with the scene, the alignment generation model computes the necessary transformations, allowing the generated meshes to be accurately placed and integrated into the scene's point cloud. Finally, CAST incorporates a physics-aware correction step that leverages a fine-grained relation graph to generate a constraint graph. This graph guides the optimization of object poses, ensuring physical consistency and spatial coherence. By utilizing Signed Distance Fields (SDF), the model effectively addresses issues such as occlusions, object penetration, and floating objects, ensuring that the generated scene accurately reflects real-world physical interactions. CAST can be leveraged in robotics, enabling efficient real-to-simulation workflows and providing realistic, scalable simulation environments for robotic systems.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12894,
45,Physical Depth-aware Early Accident Anticipation: A Multi-dimensional Visual Feature Fusion Framework,"Hongpu Huang,Wei Zhou,Chen Wang","Early accident anticipation from dashcam videos is a highly desirable yet challenging task for improving the safety of intelligent vehicles. Existing advanced accident anticipation approaches commonly model the interaction among traffic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) in the coarse 2D image space, which may not adequately capture their true positions and interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a physical depth-aware learning framework that incorporates the monocular depth features generated by a large model named Depth-Anything to introduce more fine-grained spatial 3D information. Furthermore, the proposed framework also integrates visual interaction features and visual dynamic features from traffic scenes to provide a more comprehensive perception towards the scenes. Based on these multi-dimensional visual features, the framework captures early indicators of accidents through the analysis of interaction relationships between objects in sequential frames. Additionally, the proposed framework introduces a reconstruction adjacency matrix for key traffic participants that are occluded, mitigating the impact of occluded objects on graph learning and maintaining the spatio-temporal continuity. Experimental results on public datasets show that the proposed framework attains state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating visual depth features and the superiority of the proposed framework.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18496,

However, these models have limitations in understanding complex compositional scenes involving multiple objects and their spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that diverges from commonly used strategies, which rely on the design of hard-negative augmentations. Instead, our work focuses on integrating inductive biases into pre-trained CLIP-like models to improve their compositional understanding without using any additional hard-negatives. To that end, we introduce a binding module that connects a scene graph, derived from a text description, with a slot-structured image representation, facilitating a structured similarity assessment between the two modalities. We also leverage relationships as text-conditioned visual constraints, thereby capturing the intricate interactions between objects and their contextual relationships more effectively. Our resulting model not only enhances the performance of CLIP-based models in multi-object compositional understanding but also paves the way towards more accurate and sample-efficient image-text matching of complex scenes.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14113,
47,Weakly Supervised Video Scene Graph Generation via Natural Language Supervision,"Kibum Kim,Kanghoon Yoon,Yeonjun In,Jaehyeong Jeon,Jinyoung Moon,Donghyun Kim,Chanyoung Park","Existing Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) studies are trained in a fully supervised manner, which requires all frames in a video to be annotated, thereby incurring high annotation cost compared to Image Scene Graph Generation (ImgSGG). Although the annotation cost of VidSGG can be alleviated by adopting a weakly supervised approach commonly used for ImgSGG (WS-ImgSGG) that uses image captions, there are two key reasons that hinder such a naive adoption: 1) Temporality within video captions, i.e., unlike image captions, video captions include temporal markers (e.g., before, while, then, after) that indicate time related details, and 2) Variability in action duration, i.e., unlike human actions in image captions, human actions in video captions unfold over varying duration. To address these issues, we propose a Natural Language-based Video Scene Graph Generation (NL-VSGG) framework that only utilizes the readily available video captions for training a VidSGG model. NL-VSGG consists of two key modules: Temporality-aware Caption Segmentation (TCS) module and Action Duration Variability-aware caption-frame alignment (ADV) module. Specifically, TCS segments the video captions into multiple sentences in a temporal order based on a Large Language Model (LLM), and ADV aligns each segmented sentence with appropriate frames considering the variability in action duration. Our approach leads to a significant enhancement in performance compared to simply applying the WS-ImgSGG pipeline to VidSGG on the Action Genome dataset. As a further benefit of utilizing the video captions as weak supervision, we show that the VidSGG model trained by NL-VSGG is able to predict a broader range of action classes that are not included in the training data, which makes our framework practical in reality.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15370,

We collect RGBD observation and human point-click pairs as a human annotator explores virtual and real-world environments with the goal of full coverage exploration of the space. The human annotators also provide distinct landmark examples along each trajectory, which we intuit will simplify the task of map or graph building and localization.

49,GSORB-SLAM: Gaussian Splatting SLAM benefits from ORB features and Transmittance information,"Wancai Zheng,Xinyi Yu,Jintao Rong,Linlin Ou,Yan Wei,Libo Zhou","The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently ignited a renewed wave of research in dense visual SLAM. However, existing approaches encounter challenges, including sensitivity to artifacts and noise, suboptimal selection of training viewpoints, and the absence of global optimization. In this paper, we propose GSORB-SLAM, a dense SLAM framework that integrates 3DGS with ORB features through a tightly coupled optimization pipeline. To mitigate the effects of noise and artifacts, we propose a novel geometric representation and optimization method for tracking, which significantly enhances localization accuracy and robustness. For high-fidelity mapping, we develop an adaptive Gaussian expansion and regularization method that facilitates compact yet expressive scene modeling while suppressing redundant primitives. Furthermore, we design a hybrid graph-based viewpoint selection mechanism that effectively reduces overfitting and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tracking precision-improving RMSE by 16.2% compared to ORB-SLAM2 baselines-and reconstruction quality-improving PSNR by 3.93 dB compared to 3DGS-SLAM baselines.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel zero-shot video captioning approach that combines frame-level scene graphs from a video to obtain intermediate representations for caption generation. Our method first generates frame-level captions using an image VLM, converts them into scene graphs, and consolidates these graphs to produce comprehensive video-level descriptions. To achieve this, we leverage a lightweight graph-to-text model trained solely on text corpora, eliminating the need for video captioning annotations. Experiments on the MSR-VTT and ActivityNet Captions datasets show that our approach outperforms zero-shot video captioning baselines, demonstrating that aggregating frame-level scene graphs yields rich video understanding without requiring large-scale paired data or high inference cost.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16427,
51,DynamicGSG: Dynamic 3D Gaussian Scene Graphs for Environment Adaptation,"Luzhou Ge,Xiangyu Zhu,Zhuo Yang,Xuesong Li","In real-world scenarios, environment changes caused by human or agent activities make it extremely challenging for robots to perform various long-term tasks. Recent works typically struggle to effectively understand and adapt to dynamic environments due to the inability to update their environment representations in memory according to environment changes and lack of fine-grained reconstruction of the environments. To address these challenges, we propose DynamicGSG, a dynamic, high-fidelity, open-vocabulary scene graph construction system leveraging Gaussian splatting. DynamicGSG builds hierarchical scene graphs using advanced vision language models to represent the spatial and semantic relationships between objects in the environments, utilizes a joint feature loss we designed to supervise Gaussian instance grouping while optimizing the Gaussian maps, and locally updates the Gaussian scene graphs according to real environment changes for long-term environment adaptation. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the performance and efficacy of our proposed method in terms of semantic segmentation, language-guided object retrieval, and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we validate the dynamic updating capabilities of our system in real laboratory environments.

Jin","The concept of function and affordance is a critical aspect of 3D scene understanding and supports task-oriented objectives. In this work, we develop a model that learns to structure and vary functional affordance across a 3D hierarchical scene graph representing the spatial organization of a scene. The varying functional affordance is designed to integrate with the varying spatial context of the graph. More specifically, we develop an algorithm that learns to construct a 3D hierarchical scene graph (3DHSG) that captures the spatial organization of the scene. Starting from segmented object point clouds and object semantic labels, we develop a 3DHSG with a top node that identifies the room label, child nodes that define local spatial regions inside the room with region-specific affordances, and grand-child nodes indicating object locations and object-specific affordances. To support this work, we create a custom 3DHSG dataset that provides ground truth data for local spatial regions with region-specific affordances and also object-specific affordances for each object. We employ a transformer-based model to learn the 3DHSG. We use a multi-task learning framework that learns both room classification and learns to define spatial regions within the room with region-specific affordances. Our work improves on the performance of state-of-the-art baseline models and shows one approach for applying transformer models to 3D scene understanding and the generation of 3DHSGs that capture the spatial organization of a room.

It is observed existing methods have various limitations, such as requiring precise camera poses for input and dense viewpoints for supervision. To perform effective and efficient 3D scene reconstruction, we propose a novel graph-guided 3D scene reconstruction framework, GraphGS. Specifically, given a set of images captured by RGB cameras on a scene, we first design a spatial prior-based scene structure estimation method. This is then used to create a camera graph that includes information about the camera topology. Further, we propose to apply the graph-guided multi-view consistency constraint and adaptive sampling strategy to the 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization process. This greatly alleviates the issue of Gaussian points overfitting to specific sparse viewpoints and expedites the 3D reconstruction process. We demonstrate GraphGS achieves high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from images, which presents state-of-the-art performance through quantitative and qualitative evaluation across multiple datasets.

54,Safe Leaf Manipulation for Accurate Shape and Pose Estimation of Occluded Fruits,"Shaoxiong Yao,Sicong Pan,Maren Bennewitz,Kris Hauser","Fruit monitoring plays an important role in crop management, and rising global fruit consumption combined with labor shortages necessitates automated monitoring with robots. However, occlusions from plant foliage often hinder accurate shape and pose estimation. Therefore, we propose an active fruit shape and pose estimation method that physically manipulates occluding leaves to reveal hidden fruits. This paper introduces a framework that plans robot actions to maximize visibility and minimize leaf damage. We developed a novel scene-consistent shape completion technique to improve fruit estimation under heavy occlusion and utilize a perception-driven deformation graph model to predict leaf deformation during planning. Experiments on artificial and real sweet pepper plants demonstrate that our method enables robots to safely move leaves aside, exposing fruits for accurate shape and pose estimation, outperforming baseline methods.

55,StoryWeaver: A Unified World Model for Knowledge-Enhanced Story Character Customization,"Jinlu Zhang,Jiji Tang,Rongsheng Zhang,Tangjie Lv,Xiaoshuai Sun","Story visualization has gained increasing attention in artificial intelligence. However, existing methods still struggle with maintaining a balance between character identity preservation and text-semantics alignment, largely due to a lack of detailed semantic modeling of the story scene. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge graph, namely Character Graph (\\textbf{CG}), which comprehensively represents various story-related knowledge, including the characters, the attributes related to characters, and the relationship between characters. We then introduce StoryWeaver, an image generator that achieve Customization via Character Graph (\\textbf{C-CG}), capable of consistent story visualization with rich text semantics. To further improve the multi-character generation performance, we incorporate knowledge-enhanced spatial guidance (\\textbf{KE-SG}) into StoryWeaver to precisely inject character semantics into generation. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted using a new benchmark called TBC-Bench. The experiments confirm that our StoryWeaver excels not only in creating vivid visual story plots but also in accurately conveying character identities across various scenarios with considerable storage efficiency, \\emph{e.g.}, achieving an average increase of +9.03\\% DINO-I and +13.44\\% CLIP-T.

56,QueryAdapter: Rapid Adaptation of Vision-Language Models in Response to Natural Language Queries,"Nicolas Harvey Chapman,Feras Dayoub,Will Browne,Christopher Lehnert","A domain shift exists between the large-scale, internet data used to train a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the raw image streams collected by a robot. Existing adaptation strategies require the definition of a closed-set of classes, which is impractical for a robot that must respond to diverse natural language queries. In response, we present QueryAdapter; a novel framework for rapidly adapting a pre-trained VLM in response to a natural language query. QueryAdapter leverages unlabelled data collected during previous deployments to align VLM features with semantic classes related to the query. By optimising learnable prompt tokens and actively selecting objects for training, an adapted model can be produced in a matter of minutes. We also explore how objects unrelated to the query should be dealt with when using real-world data for adaptation. In turn, we propose the use of object captions as negative class labels, helping to produce better calibrated confidence scores during adaptation. Extensive experiments on ScanNet++ demonstrate that QueryAdapter significantly enhances object retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised VLM adapters and 3D scene graph methods. Furthermore, the approach exhibits robust generalization to abstract affordance queries and other datasets, such as Ego4D.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18735,
57,Hydra-SGG: Hybrid Relation Assignment for One-stage Scene Graph Generation,"Minghan Chen,Guikun Chen,Wenguan Wang,Yi Yang","DETR introduces a simplified one-stage framework for scene graph generation (SGG) but faces challenges of sparse supervision and false negative samples. The former occurs because each image typically contains fewer than 10 relation annotations, while DETR-based SGG models employ over 100 relation queries. Each ground truth relation is assigned to only one query during training. The latter arises when one ground truth relation may have multiple queries with similar matching scores, leading to suboptimally matched queries being treated as negative samples. To address these, we propose Hydra-SGG, a one-stage SGG method featuring a Hybrid Relation Assignment. This approach combines a One-to-One Relation Assignment with an IoU-based One-to-Many Relation Assignment, increasing positive training samples and mitigating sparse supervision. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that removing self-attention between relation queries leads to duplicate predictions, which actually benefits the proposed One-to-Many Relation Assignment. With this insight, we introduce Hydra Branch, an auxiliary decoder without self-attention layers, to further enhance One-to-Many Relation Assignment by promoting different queries to make the same relation prediction. Hydra-SGG achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including VG150 (16.0 mR@50), Open Images V6 (50.1 weighted score), and GQA (12.7 mR@50).",September 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10262,
58,Narrative-Driven Travel Planning: Geoculturally-Grounded Script Generation with Evolutionary Itinerary Optimization,"Ran Ding,Ziyu Zhang,Ying Zhu,Ziqian Kong,Peilan Xu","To enhance tourists' experiences and immersion, this paper proposes a narrative-driven travel planning framework called NarrativeGuide, which generates a geoculturally-grounded narrative script for travelers, offering a novel, role-playing experience for their journey. In the initial stage, NarrativeGuide constructs a knowledge graph for attractions within a city, then configures the worldview, character setting, and exposition based on the knowledge graph. Using this foundation, the knowledge graph is combined to generate an independent scene unit for each attraction. During the itinerary planning stage, NarrativeGuide models narrative-driven travel planning as an optimization problem, utilizing a genetic algorithm (GA) to refine the itinerary. Before evaluating the candidate itinerary, transition scripts are generated for each pair of adjacent attractions, which, along with the scene units, form a complete script. The weighted sum of script coherence, travel time, and attraction scores is then used as the fitness value to update the candidate solution set. Experimental results across four cities, i.e., Nanjing and Yangzhou in China, Paris in France, and Berlin in Germany, demonstrate significant improvements in narrative coherence and cultural fit, alongside a notable reduction in travel time and an increase in the quality of visited attractions. Our study highlights that incorporating external evolutionary optimization effectively addresses the limitations of large language models in travel planning.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14456,
59,Ground-level Viewpoint Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments,"Zerui Li,Gengze Zhou,Haodong Hong,Yanyan Shao,Wenqi Lyu,Yanyuan Qiao,Qi Wu","Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) empowers agents to associate time-sequenced visual observations with corresponding instructions to make sequential decisions. However, generalization remains a persistent challenge, particularly when dealing with visually diverse scenes or transitioning from simulated environments to real-world deployment. In this paper, we address the mismatch between human-centric instructions and quadruped robots with a low-height field of view, proposing a Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVNav) approach to mitigate this issue. This work represents the first attempt to highlight the generalization gap in VLN across varying heights of visual observation in realistic robot deployments. Our approach leverages weighted historical observations as enriched spatiotemporal contexts for instruction following, effectively managing feature collisions within cells by assigning appropriate weights to identical features across different viewpoints. This enables low-height robots to overcome challenges such as visual obstructions and perceptual mismatches. Additionally, we transfer the connectivity graph from the HM3D and Gibson datasets as an extra resource to enhance spatial priors and a more comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance and generalizability of the waypoint predictor in real-world environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVnav) approach significantly improves performance in both simulated environments and real-world deployments with quadruped robots.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19024,

While vision-language research has aimed to develop models with compositional understanding capabilities, this is not reflected yet in existing datasets which, for the most part, still use plain text to describe images. In this work, we propose a new annotation strategy, graph-based captioning (GBC) that describes an image using a labeled graph structure, with nodes of various types. The nodes in GBC are created through a two-stage process: first, identifying and describing entity nodes; second, linking these nodes by highlighting \\textit{compositions} and \\textit{relations} among them. Since \\textit{all} GBC nodes hold plain text descriptions, GBC retains the flexibility found in natural language, but can also encode hierarchical information in its edges. We demonstrate that GBC can be produced automatically, using off-the-shelf multimodal LLMs and object detection models, by building a new dataset GBC10M that gathers GBC annotations for about 10M images of the CC12M dataset. Through CLIP training on GBC10M, we show that leveraging GBC nodes' annotations -- particularly those in composition and relation nodes -- significantly boosts the model's performance across various benchmarks compared to when other annotations are used. To further explore the opportunities provided by GBC, we also investigate the use of GBC as middleware for text-to-image generation, and show the extra benefits of incorporating the graph structure in this task.

61,"BiRating -- Iterative averaging on a bipartite graph of Beat Saber scores, player skills, and map difficulties",Juan Casanova,"Difficulty estimation of Beat Saber maps is an interesting data analysis problem and valuable to the Beat Saber competitive scene. We present a simple algorithm that iteratively averages player skill and map difficulty estimations in a bipartite graph of players and maps, connected by scores, using scores only as input. This approach simultaneously estimates player skills and map difficulties, exploiting each of them to improve the estimation of the other, exploitng the relation of multiple scores by different players on the same map, or on different maps by the same player. While we have been unable to prove or characterize theoretical convergence, the implementation exhibits convergent behaviour to low estimation error in all instances, producing accurate results. An informal qualitative evaluation involving experienced Beat Saber community members was carried out, comparing the difficulty estimations output by our algorithm with their personal perspectives on the difficulties of different maps. There was a significant alignment with player perceived perceptions of difficulty and with other existing methods for estimating difficulty. Our approach showed significant improvement over existing methods in certain known problematic maps that are not typically accurately estimated, but also produces problematic estimations for certain families of maps where the assumptions on the meaning of scores were inadequate (e.g. not enough scores, or scores over optimized by players). The algorithm has important limitations, related to data quality and meaningfulness, assumptions on the domain problem, and theoretical convergence of the algorithm. Future work would significantly benefit from a better understanding of adequate ways to quantify map difficulty in Beat Saber, including multidimensionality of skill and difficulty, and the systematic biases present in score data.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19742,
62,A2-GNN: Angle-Annular GNN for Visual Descriptor-free Camera Relocalization,"Yejun Zhang,Shuzhe Wang,Juho Kannala","Visual localization involves estimating the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera pose within a known scene. A critical step in this process is identifying pixel-to-point correspondences between 2D query images and 3D models. Most advanced approaches currently rely on extensive visual descriptors to establish these correspondences, facing challenges in storage, privacy issues and model maintenance. Direct 2D-3D keypoint matching without visual descriptors is becoming popular as it can overcome those challenges. However, existing descriptor-free methods suffer from low accuracy or heavy computation. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces the Angle-Annular Graph Neural Network (A2-GNN), a simple approach that efficiently learns robust geometric structural representations with annular feature extraction. Specifically, this approach clusters neighbors and embeds each group's distance information and angle as supplementary information to capture local structures. Evaluation on matching and visual localization datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with low computational overhead among visual description-free methods.

EchoScene leverages a dual-branch diffusion model that dynamically adapts to scene graphs. Existing methods struggle to handle scene graphs due to varying numbers of nodes, multiple edge combinations, and manipulator-induced node-edge operations. EchoScene overcomes this by associating each node with a denoising process and enables collaborative information exchange, enhancing controllable and consistent generation aware of global constraints. This is achieved through an information echo scheme in both shape and layout branches. At every denoising step, all processes share their denoising data with an information exchange unit that combines these updates using graph convolution. The scheme ensures that the denoising processes are influenced by a holistic understanding of the scene graph, facilitating the generation of globally coherent scenes. The resulting scenes can be manipulated during inference by editing the input scene graph and sampling the noise in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments validate our approach, which maintains scene controllability and surpasses previous methods in generation fidelity. Moreover, the generated scenes are of high quality and thus directly compatible with off-the-shelf texture generation.

64,S-Graphs 2.0 -- A Hierarchical-Semantic Optimization and Loop Closure for SLAM,"Hriday Bavle,Jose Luis Sanchez-Lopez,Muhammad Shaheer,Javier Civera,Holger Voos","The hierarchical structure of 3D scene graphs shows a high relevance for representations purposes, as it fits common patterns from man-made environments. But, additionally, the semantic and geometric information in such hierarchical representations could be leveraged to speed up the optimization and management of map elements and robot poses.  In this direction, we present our work Situational Graphs 2.0 (S-Graphs 2.0), which leverages the hierarchical structure of indoor scenes for efficient data management and optimization. Our algorithm begins by constructing a situational graph that represents the environment into four layers: Keyframes, Walls, Rooms, and Floors. Our first novelty lies in the front-end, which includes a floor detection module capable of identifying stairways and assigning floor-level semantic relations to the underlying layers. Floor-level semantics allows us to propose a floor-based loop closure strategy, that effectively rejects false positive closures that typically appear due to aliasing between different floors of a building. Our second novelty lies in leveraging our representation hierarchy in the optimization. Our proposal consists of: (1) local optimization over a window of recent keyframes and their connected components across the four representation layers, (2) floor-level global optimization, which focuses only on keyframes and their connections within the current floor during loop closures, and (3) room-level local optimization, marginalizing redundant keyframes that share observations within the room, which reduces the computational footprint. We validate our algorithm extensively in different real multi-floor environments.

Screenplays are not only lengthy, but also feature a complex interplay of characters, dialogues, and scenes, with numerous direct and subtle relationships and contextual nuances that are difficult for machine learning models to accurately capture and comprehend. Recent attempts at screenplay summarization focus on fine-tuning transformer-based pre-trained models, but these models often fall short in capturing long-term dependencies and latent relationships, and frequently encounter the ""lost in the middle"" issue. To address these challenges, we introduce DiscoGraMS, a novel resource that represents movie scripts as a movie character-aware discourse graph (CaD Graph). This approach is well-suited for various downstream tasks, such as summarization, question-answering, and salience detection. The model aims to preserve all salient information, offering a more comprehensive and faithful representation of the screenplay's content.

Ngo,Truong Do,Dezhen Song,Truong-Son Hy","Scene graphs have proven to be highly effective for various scene understanding tasks due to their compact and explicit representation of relational information. However, current methods often overlook the critical importance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with noisy, multi-view data. Furthermore, a major limitation of prior approaches is the lack of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent relationships among dynamically evolving entities in a scene. To address these challenges, we propose Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (TESGNN), consisting of two key components: (1) an Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (ESGNN), which extracts information from 3D point clouds to generate scene graph while preserving crucial symmetry properties, and (2) a Temporal Graph Matching Network, which fuses scene graphs generated by ESGNN across multiple time sequences into a unified global representation using an approximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture TESGNN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in scene graph generation, achieving higher accuracy and faster training convergence. Moreover, we show that leveraging the symmetry-preserving property produces a more stable and accurate global scene representation compared to existing approaches. Last but not least, it is computationally efficient and easily implementable using existing frameworks, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision.

This paper introduces visual S-Graphs (vS-Graphs), a novel real-time VSLAM framework that integrates vision-based scene understanding with map reconstruction and comprehensible graph-based representation.

Traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches struggle to maintain consistent scene representations because of numerous moving objects, often treating dynamic elements as outliers rather than explicitly modeling them in the scene representation. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical 3D scene graph-based SLAM framework that addresses the challenge of modeling and estimating the pose of dynamic objects and agents. We use fiducial markers to detect dynamic entities and to extract their attributes while improving keyframe selection and implementing new capabilities for dynamic entity mapping. We maintain a hierarchical representation where dynamic objects are registered in the SLAM graph and are constrained with robot keyframes and the floor level of the building with our novel entity-keyframe constraints and intra-entity constraints. By combining semantic and geometric constraints between dynamic entities and the environment, our system jointly optimizes the SLAM graph to estimate the pose of the robot and various dynamic agents and objects while maintaining an accurate map.

While existing ToM reasoning methods show promise with reasoning via perceptual perspective-taking, they often rely excessively on LLMs, reducing their efficiency and limiting their applicability to high-order ToM reasoning, which requires multi-hop reasoning about characters' beliefs. To address these issues, we present EnigmaToM, a novel neuro-symbolic framework that enhances ToM reasoning by integrating a Neural Knowledge Base of entity states (Enigma) for (1) a psychology-inspired iterative masking mechanism that facilitates accurate perspective-taking and (2) knowledge injection that elicits key entity information. Enigma generates structured representations of entity states, which construct spatial scene graphs -- leveraging spatial information as an inductive bias -- for belief tracking of various ToM orders and enhancing events with fine-grained entity state details. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks, including ToMi, HiToM, and FANToM, show that EnigmaToM significantly improves ToM reasoning across LLMs of varying sizes, particularly excelling in high-order reasoning scenarios.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03340,

Recently, 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional grid maps, blending efficient memory use and rich feature representation. However, most efforts to apply them have been limited to static worlds. This work introduces REACT, a framework that efficiently performs real-time attribute clustering and transfer to relocalize object nodes in a 3DSG. REACT employs a novel method for comparing object instances using an embedding model trained on triplet loss, facilitating instance clustering and matching. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT is able to relocalize objects while maintaining computational efficiency.

However, existing methods primarily focus on embedding compressed CLIP features to 3D Gaussians, suffering from low object segmentation accuracy and lack spatial reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose GaussianGraph, a novel framework that enhances 3DGS-based scene understanding by integrating adaptive semantic clustering and scene graph generation. We introduce a ""Control-Follow"" clustering strategy, which dynamically adapts to scene scale and feature distribution, avoiding feature compression and significantly improving segmentation accuracy. Additionally, we enrich scene representation by integrating object attributes and spatial relations extracted from 2D foundation models. To address inaccuracies in spatial relationships, we propose 3D correction modules that filter implausible relations through spatial consistency verification, ensuring reliable scene graph construction. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that GaussianGraph outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic segmentation and object grounding tasks, providing a robust solution for complex scene understanding and interaction.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04034,

In recent years, multimodal place recognition methods have gained increasing attention. They overcome the weaknesses of unimodal sensor systems by leveraging complementary information from different modalities. However, most existing methods explore cross-modality correlations through feature-level or descriptor-level fusion, suffering from a lack of interpretability. Conversely, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new perspective on multimodal fusion by harmonizing different modalities into an explicit scene representation. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based multimodal place recognition network dubbed GSPR. It explicitly combines multi-view RGB images and LiDAR point clouds into a spatio-temporally unified scene representation with the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. A network composed of 3D graph convolution and transformer is designed to extract spatio-temporal features and global descriptors from the Gaussian scenes for place recognition. Extensive evaluations on three datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively leverage complementary strengths of both multi-view cameras and LiDAR, achieving SOTA place recognition performance while maintaining solid generalization ability.

76,FORESCENE: FOREcasting human activity via latent SCENE graphs diffusion,"Antonio Alliegro,Francesca Pistilli,Tatiana Tommasi,Giuseppe Averta","Forecasting human-environment interactions in daily activities is challenging due to the high variability of human behavior. While predicting directly from videos is possible, it is limited by confounding factors like irrelevant objects or background noise that do not contribute to the interaction. A promising alternative is using Scene Graphs (SGs) to track only the relevant elements. However, current methods for forecasting future SGs face significant challenges and often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as fixed objects over time, limiting their applicability to long-term activities where interacted objects may appear or disappear. In this paper, we introduce FORESCENE, a novel framework for Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) that predicts both object and relationship evolution over time. FORESCENE encodes observed video segments into a latent representation using a tailored Graph Auto-Encoder and forecasts future SGs using a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Our approach enables continuous prediction of interaction dynamics without making assumptions on the graph's content or structure. We evaluate FORESCENE on the Action Genome dataset, where it outperforms existing SGA methods while solving a significantly more complex task.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06182,

With ground truth scene graphs and temporal interval annotations, MOMA-QA is ideal for developing models for fine-grained video understanding. Furthermore, we present a novel video-language model, SGVLM, which incorporates a scene graph predictor, an efficient frame retriever, and a pre-trained large language model for temporal localization and fine-grained relationship understanding.

Current methods either lack user control or rely on imprecise, non-intuitive conditions. In this work, we propose a method that uses, scene graphs, an accessible, user friendly control format to generate outdoor 3D scenes. We develop an interactive system that transforms a sparse scene graph into a dense BEV (Bird's Eye View) Embedding Map, which guides a conditional diffusion model to generate 3D scenes that match the scene graph description. During inference, users can easily create or modify scene graphs to generate large-scale outdoor scenes. We create a large-scale dataset with paired scene graphs and 3D semantic scenes to train the BEV embedding and diffusion models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently produces high-quality 3D urban scenes closely aligned with the input scene graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to generate 3D outdoor scenes conditioned on scene graphs.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07152,
79,Is the House Ready For Sleeptime? Generating and Evaluating Situational Queries for Embodied Question Answering,"Vishnu Sashank Dorbala,Prasoon Goyal,Robinson Piramuthu,Michael Johnston,Reza Ghanadhan,Dinesh Manocha","We present and tackle the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA) with Situational Queries (S-EQA) in a household environment. Unlike prior EQA work tackling simple queries that directly reference target objects and properties (""What is the color of the car?""), situational queries (such as ""Is the house ready for sleeptime?"") are challenging as they require the agent to correctly identify multiple object-states (Doors: Closed, Lights: Off, etc.) and reach a consensus on their states for an answer. Towards this objective, we first introduce a novel Prompt-Generate-Evaluate (PGE) scheme that wraps around an LLM's output to generate unique situational queries and corresponding consensus object information. PGE is used to generate 2K datapoints in the VirtualHome simulator, which is then annotated for ground truth answers via a large scale user-study conducted on M-Turk. With a high rate of answerability (97.26%) on this study, we establish that LLMs are good at generating situational data. However, in evaluating the data using an LLM, we observe a low correlation of 46.2% with the ground truth human annotations; indicating that while LLMs are good at generating situational data, they struggle to answer them according to consensus. When asked for reasoning, we observe the LLM often goes against commonsense in justifying its answer. Finally, we utilize PGE to generate situational data in a real-world environment, exposing LLM hallucination in generating reliable object-states when a structured scene graph is unavailable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce EQA in the context of situational queries and also the first to present a generative approach for query creation. We aim to foster research on improving the real-world usability of embodied agents through this work.",May 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04732,

Dynamizing Topological Graphs for Embodied Navigation","Vishnu Sashank Dorbala,Bhrij Patel,Amrit Singh Bedi,Dinesh Manocha","Embodied Navigation tasks often involve constructing topological graphs of a scene during exploration to facilitate high-level planning and decision-making for execution in continuous environments. Prior literature makes the assumption of static graphs with stationary targets, which does not hold in many real-world environments with moving objects. To address this, we present a novel formulation generalizing navigation to dynamic environments by introducing structured object transitions to dynamize static topological graphs called Object Transition Graphs (OTGs). OTGs simulate portable targets following structured routes inspired by human habits. We apply this technique to Matterport3D (MP3D), a popular simulator for evaluating embodied tasks. On these dynamized OTGs, we establish a navigation benchmark by evaluating Oracle-based, Reinforcement Learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches on a multi-object finding task. Further, we quantify agent adaptability, and make key inferences such as agents employing learned decision-making strategies generalize better than those relying on privileged oracle knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to introduce structured temporal dynamism on topological graphs for studying generalist embodied navigation policies. The code and dataset for our OTGs will be made publicly available to foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes.",March 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09905,

Arras","The concept of 3D scene graphs is increasingly recognized as a powerful semantic and hierarchical representation of the environment. Current approaches often address this at a coarse, object-level resolution. In contrast, our goal is to develop a representation that enables robots to directly interact with their environment by identifying both the location of functional interactive elements and how these can be used. To achieve this, we focus on detecting and storing objects at a finer resolution, focusing on affordance-relevant parts. The primary challenge lies in the scarcity of data that extends beyond instance-level detection and the inherent difficulty of capturing detailed object features using robotic sensors. We leverage currently available 3D resources to generate 2D data and train a detector, which is then used to augment the standard 3D scene graph generation pipeline. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves functional element segmentation comparable to state-of-the-art 3D models and that our augmentation enables task-driven affordance grounding with higher accuracy than the current solutions.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07909,

However, the world in which we live is dynamic, characterized by numerous interactions between the environment and humans or robotic agents. Static semantic maps are unable to capture this information, and the naive solution of rescanning the environment after every change is both costly and ineffective in tracking e.g. objects being stored away in drawers. With Lost & Found we present an approach that addresses this limitation. Based solely on egocentric recordings with corresponding hand position and camera pose estimates, we are able to track the 6DoF poses of the moving object within the detected interaction interval. These changes are applied online to a transformable scene graph that captures object-level relations. Compared to state-of-the-art object pose trackers, our approach is more reliable in handling the challenging egocentric viewpoint and the lack of depth information. It outperforms the second-best approach by 34% and 56% for translational and orientational error, respectively, and produces visibly smoother 6DoF object trajectories. In addition, we illustrate how the acquired interaction information in the dynamic scene graph can be employed in the context of robotic applications that would otherwise be unfeasible: We show how our method allows to command a mobile manipulator through teach & repeat, and how information about prior interaction allows a mobile manipulator to retrieve an object hidden in a drawer.

However, existing 3D understanding is predominantly based on 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), collecting and processing limited scene-aware contexts. Instead, compared to the 2D planar visual information, point cloud sensors like LiDAR offer rich depth information and fine-grained 3D representations of objects. Meanwhile, the emerging 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is capable of detecting the motion trend, velocity, and reflection intensity of each object. Therefore, the integration of these two modalities provides more flexible querying conditions for natural language, enabling more accurate 3D visual grounding. To this end, in this paper, we exploratively propose a novel method called TPCNet, the first outdoor 3D visual grounding model upon the paradigm of prompt-guided point cloud sensor combination, including both LiDAR and radar contexts. To adaptively balance the features of these two sensors required by the prompt, we have designed a multi-fusion paradigm called Two-Stage Heterogeneous Modal Adaptive Fusion. Specifically, this paradigm initially employs Bidirectional Agent Cross-Attention (BACA), which feeds dual-sensor features, characterized by global receptive fields, to the text features for querying. Additionally, we have designed a Dynamic Gated Graph Fusion (DGGF) module to locate the regions of interest identified by the queries. To further enhance accuracy, we innovatively devise an C3D-RECHead, based on the nearest object edge. Our experiments have demonstrated that our TPCNet, along with its individual modules, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the Talk2Radar and Talk2Car datasets.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08336,

While purely geometric maps using voxel grids allow for general navigation, obtaining up-to-date spatial and semantically rich representations that scale to dynamic large-scale environments remains challenging. In this work, we present CURB-OSG, an open-vocabulary dynamic 3D scene graph engine that generates hierarchical decompositions of urban driving scenes via multi-agent collaboration. By fusing the camera and LiDAR observations from multiple perceiving agents with unknown initial poses, our approach generates more accurate maps compared to a single agent while constructing a unified open-vocabulary semantic hierarchy of the scene. Unlike previous methods that rely on ground truth agent poses or are evaluated purely in simulation, CURB-OSG alleviates these constraints. We evaluate the capabilities of CURB-OSG on real-world multi-agent sensor data obtained from multiple sessions of the Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset.

However, manually creating such scenarios in simulation remains a significant and time-consuming challenge. This work introduces a novel method that generates dynamic temporal scene graphs corresponding to diverse traffic scenarios, on-demand, tailored to user-defined preferences, such as AV actions, sets of dynamic agents, and criticality levels. A temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) model learns to predict relationships between ego-vehicle, agents, and static structures, guided by real-world spatiotemporal interaction patterns and constrained by an ontology that restricts predictions to semantically valid links.

86,Visual Attention Graph,"Kai-Fu Yang,Yong-Jie Li","Visual attention plays a critical role when our visual system executes active visual tasks by interacting with the physical scene. However, how to encode the visual object relationship in the psychological world of our brain deserves to be explored. In the field of computer vision, predicting visual fixations or scanpaths is a usual way to explore the visual attention and behaviors of human observers when viewing a scene. Most existing methods encode visual attention using individual fixations or scanpaths based on the raw gaze shift data collected from human observers. This may not capture the common attention pattern well, because without considering the semantic information of the viewed scene, raw gaze shift data alone contain high inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this issue, we propose a new attention representation, called Attention Graph, to simultaneously code the visual saliency and scanpath in a graph-based representation and better reveal the common attention behavior of human observers. In the attention graph, the semantic-based scanpath is defined by the path on the graph, while saliency of objects can be obtained by computing fixation density on each node. Systemic experiments demonstrate that the proposed attention graph combined with our new evaluation metrics provides a better benchmark for evaluating attention prediction methods. Meanwhile, extra experiments demonstrate the promising potentials of the proposed attention graph in assessing human cognitive states, such as autism spectrum disorder screening and age classification.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08531,

However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MB-GS), a novel framework that uses motion graph as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of graph links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions determining the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MB-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF.

Recent advancements in trajectory planning have leveraged vision-language models (VLMs) to extract contextual information for robots operating in real-world environments. While these methods achieve satisfying performance, they do not explicitly model human activities. Such activities influence surrounding objects and reshape spatial constraints. This paper presents a novel approach to trajectory planning that integrates human preferences, activities, and spatial context through an enriched 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation. By incorporating activity-based relationships, our method captures the spatial impact of human actions, leading to more context-sensitive trajectory adaptation. Preliminary results demonstrate that our approach effectively assigns costs to spaces influenced by human activities, ensuring that the robot trajectory remains contextually appropriate and sensitive to the ongoing environment. This balance between task efficiency and social appropriateness enhances context-aware human-robot interactions in domestic settings.

This approach has gained strong traction, with DUSt3R and MASt3R collectively cited over 250 times in a short span, underscoring their impact. However, despite its accuracy, MASt3R's inference speed remains a bottleneck. On an A40 GPU, latency per image pair is 198.16 ms, mainly due to computational overhead from the ViT encoder-decoder and Fast Reciprocal Nearest Neighbor (FastNN) matching.  To address this, we introduce Speedy MASt3R, a post-training optimization framework that enhances inference efficiency while maintaining accuracy. It integrates multiple optimization techniques, including FlashMatch-an approach leveraging FlashAttention v2 with tiling strategies for improved efficiency, computation graph optimization via layer and tensor fusion having kernel auto-tuning with TensorRT (GraphFusion), and a streamlined FastNN pipeline that reduces memory access time from quadratic to linear while accelerating block-wise correlation scoring through vectorized computation (FastNN-Lite). Additionally, it employs mixed-precision inference with FP16/FP32 hybrid computations (HybridCast), achieving speedup while preserving numerical precision. Evaluated on Aachen Day-Night, InLoc, 7-Scenes, ScanNet1500, and MegaDepth1500, Speedy MASt3R achieves a 54% reduction in inference time (198 ms to 91 ms per image pair) without sacrificing accuracy.

However, when applied to these tasks, LLMs often encounter challenges, such as hallucinations and mathematical inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph-Grounded LLMs, a system that improves LLM performance on graph-related tasks by integrating a graph library through function calls.

However, existing map representations that support open-vocabulary queries often involve large data volumes, which becomes a bottleneck for multi-robot transmission in communication-limited environments. To address this challenge, we develop a method to construct a graph-structured 3D representation called COGraph, where nodes represent objects with semantic features and edges capture their spatial adjacency relationships. Before transmission, a data-driven feature encoder is applied to compress the feature dimensions of the COGraph. Upon receiving COGraphs from other robots, the semantic features of each node are recovered using a decoder. We also propose a feature-based approach for place recognition and translation estimation, enabling the merging of local COGraphs into a unified global map.

In this paper, we propose a semantic graph-enhanced SLAM framework, named SG-SLAM, which effectively leverages the geometric, semantic, and topological characteristics inherent in environmental structures. The semantic graph serves as a fundamental component that facilitates critical functionalities of SLAM, including robust relocalization during odometry failures, accurate loop closing, and semantic graph map construction. Our method employs a dual-threaded architecture, with one thread dedicated to online odometry and relocalization, while the other handles loop closure, pose graph optimization, and map update. This design enables our method to operate in real time and generate globally consistent semantic graph maps and point cloud maps. We extensively evaluate our method across the KITTI, MulRAN, and Apollo datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method has been released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/SG-SLAM.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11145,

In contrast to existing methods that directly synthesize the scene layout as a scene graph or object list, CHOrD incorporates a 2D image-based intermediate layout representation, enabling effective prevention of collision artifacts by successfully capturing them as out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios during generation. Furthermore, unlike existing methods, CHOrD is capable of generating scene layouts that adhere to complex floor plans with multi-modal controls, enabling the creation of coherent, house-wide layouts robust to both geometric and semantic variations in room structures. Additionally, we propose a novel dataset with expanded coverage of household items and room configurations, as well as significantly improved data quality. CHOrD demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the 3D-FRONT and our proposed datasets, delivering photorealistic, spatially coherent indoor scene synthesis adaptable to arbitrary floor plan variations.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11958,
98,Real-Time Manipulation Action Recognition with a Factorized Graph Sequence Encoder,"Enes Erdogan,Eren Erdal Aksoy,Sanem Sariel","Recognition of human manipulation actions in real-time is essential for safe and effective human-robot interaction and collaboration. The challenge lies in developing a model that is both lightweight enough for real-time execution and capable of generalization. While some existing methods in the literature can run in real-time, they struggle with temporal scalability, i.e., they fail to adapt to long-duration manipulations effectively. To address this, leveraging the generalizable scene graph representations, we propose a new Factorized Graph Sequence Encoder network that not only runs in real-time but also scales effectively in the temporal dimension, thanks to its factorized encoder architecture. Additionally, we introduce Hand Pooling operation, a simple pooling operation for more focused extraction of the graph-level embeddings. Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art real-time approach, achieving a 14.3\\% and 5.6\\% improvement in F1-macro score on the KIT Bimanual Action (Bimacs) Dataset and Collaborative Action (CoAx) Dataset, respectively. Moreover, we conduct an extensive ablation study to validate our network design choices.

99,Salient Temporal Encoding for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation,Zhihao Zhu,"Representing a dynamic scene using a structured spatial-temporal scene graph is a novel and particularly challenging task. To tackle this task, it is crucial to learn the temporal interactions between objects in addition to their spatial relations. Due to the lack of explicitly annotated temporal relations in current benchmark datasets, most of the existing spatial-temporal scene graph generation methods build dense and abstract temporal connections among all objects across frames. However, not all temporal connections are encoding meaningful temporal dynamics. We propose a novel spatial-temporal scene graph generation method that selectively builds temporal connections only between temporal-relevant objects pairs and represents the temporal relations as explicit edges in the scene graph. The resulting sparse and explicit temporal representation allows us to improve upon strong scene graph generation baselines by up to $4.4\\%$ in Scene Graph Detection. In addition, we show that our approach can be leveraged to improve downstream vision tasks. Particularly, applying our approach to action recognition, shows 0.6\\% gain in mAP in comparison to the state-of-the-art",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14524,

However, their inherent non-linearity presents significant challenges for effective planning. Current planning methods, often dependent on extensive sampling or local gradient descent, struggle with long-horizon motion planning tasks involving complex contact events. In this paper, we present a GPU-accelerated branch-and-bound (BaB) framework for motion planning in manipulation tasks that require trajectory optimization over neural dynamics models. Our approach employs a specialized branching heuristics to divide the search space into subdomains, and applies a modified bound propagation method, inspired by the state-of-the-art neural network verifier alpha-beta-CROWN, to efficiently estimate objective bounds within these subdomains. The branching process guides planning effectively, while the bounding process strategically reduces the search space. Our framework achieves superior planning performance, generating high-quality state-action trajectories and surpassing existing methods in challenging, contact-rich manipulation tasks such as non-prehensile planar pushing with obstacles, object sorting, and rope routing in both simulated and real-world settings. Furthermore, our framework supports various neural network architectures, ranging from simple multilayer perceptrons to advanced graph neural dynamics models, and scales efficiently with different model sizes.",December 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09584,

Graph neural networks combined with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which consist of 14,000 to 500 millions parameters, generate features for visual entities (e.g., scene and object types) and identify the entities that contribute to the decision. In this paper, we show that using a simpler combination of transfer learning and a CNN to relate privacy with scene types optimises only 732 parameters while achieving comparable performance to that of graph-based methods. On the contrary, end-to-end training of graph-based methods can mask the contribution of individual components to the classification performance. Furthermore, we show that a high-dimensional feature vector, extracted with CNNs for each visual entity, is unnecessary and complexifies the model. The graph component has also negligible impact on performance, which is driven by fine-tuning the CNN to optimise image features for privacy nodes.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12464,

However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves.

Though demonstrating promising performance, they remain unable to handle real-time video streams and consume large GPU memory. Moreover, these approaches fall short in temporal reasoning, merely aggregating frame-level predictions over a temporal context. In response, we introduce DIFFVSGG, an online VSGG solution that frames this task as an iterative scene graph update problem. Drawing inspiration from Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) which generate images via denoising a latent feature embedding, we unify the decoding of object classification, bounding box regression, and graph generation three tasks using one shared feature embedding. Then, given an embedding containing unified features of object pairs, we conduct a step-wise Denoising on it within LDMs, so as to deliver a clean embedding which clearly indicates the relationships between objects. This embedding then serves as the input to task-specific heads for object classification, scene graph generation, etc. DIFFVSGG further facilitates continuous temporal reasoning, where predictions for subsequent frames leverage results of past frames as the conditional inputs of LDMs, to guide the reverse diffusion process for current frames. Extensive experiments on three setups of Action Genome demonstrate the superiority of DIFFVSGG.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13957,

We argue that latent codes stored in many NeRF SLAM systems are not fully exploited, as they are only used for better reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to detect potential loops using the same latent codes as local features. To further improve the loop detection performance, we use the semantic information, which are also decoded from the same latent codes to guide the aggregation of local features. Finally, with the potential loops detected, we close them with a graph optimization followed by bundle adjustment to refine both the estimated poses and the reconstructed scene. To evaluate the performance of our SLC$^2$-SLAM, we conduct extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet datasets. Our proposed semantic-guided loop closure significantly outperforms the pre-trained NetVLAD and ORB combined with Bag-of-Words, which are used in all the other NeRF SLAM with loop closure.

Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages.

A graph-attention backbone allows for the system geometry to be passed to the DNN, where residual convolutional layers extract features about the objects, while a UNet head performs the final image reconstruction.

However, existing novel view synthesis methods struggle with temporal coherence and visual fidelity, leading to flickering and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce history-awareness, leveraging previous frames to reconstruct the scene and improve quality and stability. We propose a hybrid splat-voxel feed-forward scene reconstruction approach that combines Gaussian Splatting to propagate information over time, with a hierarchical voxel grid for temporal fusion. Gaussian primitives are efficiently warped over time using a motion graph that extends 2D tracking models to 3D motion, while a sparse voxel transformer integrates new temporal observations in an error-aware manner. Crucially, our method does not require training on multi-view video datasets, which are currently limited in size and diversity, and can be directly applied to sparse-view video streams in a history-aware manner at inference time. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static and streaming scene reconstruction, effectively reducing temporal artifacts and visual artifacts while running at interactive rates (15 fps with 350ms delay) on a single H100 GPU.

Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks.

In the real world, multiple modalities often coexist, with different types, such as images, text, video, and 3D data, expressing distinct characteristics. Unfortunately, current SG research is largely confined to single-modality scene modeling, preventing the full utilization of the complementary strengths of different modality SG representations in depicting holistic scene semantics. To this end, we introduce Universal SG (USG), a novel representation capable of fully characterizing comprehensive semantic scenes from any given combination of modality inputs, encompassing modality-invariant and modality-specific scenes. Further, we tailor a niche-targeting USG parser, USG-Par, which effectively addresses two key bottlenecks of cross-modal object alignment and out-of-domain challenges. We design the USG-Par with modular architecture for end-to-end USG generation, in which we devise an object associator to relieve the modality gap for cross-modal object alignment.

Unfortunately, current pioneering 4D-PSG research can primarily suffer from data scarcity issues severely, as well as the resulting out-of-vocabulary problems; also, the pipeline nature of the benchmark generation method can lead to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, this paper investigates a novel framework for 4D-PSG generation that leverages rich 2D visual scene annotations to enhance 4D scene learning. First, we introduce a 4D Large Language Model (4D-LLM) integrated with a 3D mask decoder for end-to-end generation of 4D-PSG. A chained SG inference mechanism is further designed to exploit LLMs' open-vocabulary capabilities to infer accurate and comprehensive object and relation labels iteratively.

The strong performances of large language models (LLMs) in long-text generation call us to propose a LLM based framework Reader-Rewriter (R$^2$) for this task. However, there are two fundamental challenges here. First, the LLM hallucinations may cause inconsistent plot extraction and screenplay generation. Second, the causality-embedded plot lines should be effectively extracted for coherent rewriting. Therefore, two corresponding tactics are proposed: 1) A hallucination-aware refinement method (HAR) to iteratively discover and eliminate the affections of hallucinations; and 2) a causal plot-graph construction method (CPC) based on a greedy cycle-breaking algorithm to efficiently construct plot lines with event causalities. Recruiting those efficient techniques, R$^2$ utilizes two modules to mimic the human screenplay rewriting process: The Reader module adopts a sliding window and CPC to build the causal plot graphs, while the Rewriter module generates first the scene outlines based on the graphs and then the screenplays. HAR is integrated into both modules for accurate inferences of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R$^2$, which substantially outperforms three existing approaches (51.3%, 22.6%, and 57.1% absolute increases) in pairwise comparison at the overall win rate for GPT-4o.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15655,

On the other hand, recent advances of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown great capabilities in video understanding, yet they have not been tested on fine-grained, frame-wise understanding tasks like DSGG. In this work, we conduct the first systematic analysis of Video LMMs for performing DSGG.

Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our '2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization from two-view edges. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size.

To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x.

Existing text-to-video alignment metrics like CLIPScore only generate coarse-grained scores without fine-grained alignment details, failing to align with human preference. To address this limitation, we propose ETVA, a novel Evaluation method of Text-to-Video Alignment via fine-grained question generation and answering. First, a multi-agent system parses prompts into semantic scene graphs to generate atomic questions. Then we design a knowledge-augmented multi-stage reasoning framework for question answering, where an auxiliary LLM first retrieves relevant common-sense knowledge (e.g., physical laws), and then video LLM answers the generated questions through a multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ETVA achieves a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 58.47, showing a much higher correlation with human judgment than existing metrics which attain only 31.0. We also construct a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for text-to-video alignment evaluation, featuring 2k diverse prompts and 12k atomic questions spanning 10 categories. Through a systematic evaluation of 15 existing text-to-video models, we identify their key capabilities and limitations, paving the way for next-generation T2V generation.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16867,
121,"A Unified Framework for Real-Time Failure Handling in Robotics Using Vision-Language Models, Reactive Planner and Behavior Trees","Faseeh Ahmad,Hashim Ismail,Jonathan Styrud,Maj Stenmark,Volker Krueger","Robotic systems often face execution failures due to unexpected obstacles, sensor errors, or environmental changes. Traditional failure recovery methods rely on predefined strategies or human intervention, making them less adaptable. This paper presents a unified failure recovery framework that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs), a reactive planner, and Behavior Trees (BTs) to enable real-time failure handling. Our approach includes pre-execution verification, which checks for potential failures before execution, and reactive failure handling, which detects and corrects failures during execution by verifying existing BT conditions, adding missing preconditions and, when necessary, generating new skills. The framework uses a scene graph for structured environmental perception and an execution history for continuous monitoring, enabling context-aware and adaptive failure handling. We evaluate our framework through real-world experiments with an ABB YuMi robot on tasks like peg insertion, object sorting, and drawer placement, as well as in AI2-THOR simulator. Compared to using pre-execution and reactive methods separately, our approach achieves higher task success rates and greater adaptability. Ablation studies highlight the importance of VLM-based reasoning, structured scene representation, and execution history tracking for effective failure recovery in robotics.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15202,

In this work, we explore the advantages of incorporating 3D spatial information through hybrid architectures that combine 3D neural network models with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal modeling, using LiDAR-based point clouds as input. We systematically evaluate four hybrid 3D models, all of which outperform the 2D-only baseline, with the Graph Neural Network (GNN) - RNN model yielding the best results.  To reduce reliance on LiDAR, we leverage a pretrained unified model to estimate depth from monocular images, reconstructing pseudo-3D point clouds. We then adapt the GNN-RNN model, originally designed for LiDAR-based point clouds, to work with these pseudo-3D representations, achieving comparable or even superior performance compared to the LiDAR-based model. Additionally, the unified model provides semantic labels for each point, enabling a more structured scene representation. To further optimize graph construction, we introduce an efficient connectivity strategy where connections are predominantly formed between points of the same semantic class, with only 20\\% of inter-class connections retained. This targeted approach reduces graph complexity and computational cost while preserving critical spatial relationships.  Finally, we validate our approach on the KITTI dataset, achieving a 71% improvement over 2D-only models. Our findings highlight the advantages of 3D spatial information and efficient graph construction for steering estimation, while maintaining the cost-effectiveness of monocular images and avoiding the expense of LiDAR-based systems.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17153,

While synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising alternative, a notable performance gap remains compared to models trained on real data, particularly as task complexity grows. Concurrently, Neuro-Symbolic methods, which combine neural networks' learning strengths with symbolic reasoning's structured representations, have demonstrated significant potential across various cognitive tasks. This paper explores the utility of Neuro-Symbolic conditioning for synthetic image dataset generation, focusing specifically on improving the performance of Scene Graph Generation models. The research investigates whether structured symbolic representations in the form of scene graphs can enhance synthetic data quality through explicit encoding of relational constraints. The results demonstrate that Neuro-Symbolic conditioning yields significant improvements of up to +2.59% in standard Recall metrics and +2.83% in No Graph Constraint Recall metrics when used for dataset augmentation. These findings establish that merging Neuro-Symbolic and generative approaches produces synthetic data with complementary structural information that enhances model performance when combined with real data, providing a novel approach to overcome data scarcity limitations even for complex visual reasoning tasks.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17224,

This data offers significant potential for high-quality novel view synthesis, which is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicle simulators. However, inherent challenges in multi-traversal data often result in suboptimal reconstruction quality, including variations in appearance and the presence of dynamic objects. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Traversal Gaussian Splatting (MTGS), a novel approach that reconstructs high-quality driving scenes from arbitrarily collected multi-traversal data by modeling a shared static geometry while separately handling dynamic elements and appearance variations. Our method employs a multi-traversal dynamic scene graph with a shared static node and traversal-specific dynamic nodes, complemented by color correction nodes with learnable spherical harmonics coefficient residuals. This approach enables high-fidelity novel view synthesis and provides flexibility to navigate any viewpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale driving dataset, nuPlan, with multi-traversal data. Our results demonstrate that MTGS improves LPIPS by 23.5% and geometry accuracy by 46.3% compared to single-traversal baselines.

126,LAYOUTDREAMER: Physics-guided Layout for Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation,"Yang Zhou,Zongjin He,Qixuan Li,Chao Wang","Recently, the field of text-guided 3D scene generation has garnered significant attention. High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01949,

In this paper, we employ causal inference techniques to model the causality among these observed skewed distributions. Our insight lies in the ability of causal inference to capture the unobservable causal effects between complex distributions, which is crucial for tracing the roots of model bias. Specifically, we introduce the Mediator-based Causal Chain Model (MCCM), which, in addition to modeling causality among objects, object pairs, and relationships, incorporates mediator variables, i.e., cooccurrence distribution, for complementing the causality. Following this, we propose the Causal Adjustment Module (CAModule) to estimate the modeled causal structure, using variables from MCCM as inputs to produce a set of adjustment factors aimed at correcting biased model predictions. Moreover, our method enables the composition of zero-shot relationships, thereby enhancing the model's ability to recognize such relationships. Experiments conducted across various SGG backbones and popular benchmarks demonstrate that CAModule achieves state-of-the-art mean recall rates, with significant improvements also observed on the challenging zero-shot recall rate metric.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17862,

Yet, reasonably manipulating scene graphs -- whether by adding nodes or modifying edges -- remains a challenging and untouched task. Tasks such as adding a node to the graph or reasoning about a node's relationships with all others are computationally intractable, as even a single edge modification can trigger conflicts due to the intricate interdependencies within the graph. To address these challenges, we introduce SG-Tailor, an autoregressive model that predicts the conflict-free relationship between any two nodes. SG-Tailor not only infers inter-object relationships, including generating commonsense edges for newly added nodes but also resolves conflicts arising from edge modifications to produce coherent, manipulated graphs for downstream tasks. For node addition, the model queries the target node and other nodes from the graph to predict the appropriate relationships. For edge modification, SG-Tailor employs a Cut-And-Stitch strategy to solve the conflicts and globally adjust the graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SG-Tailor outperforms competing methods by a large margin and can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-in module for scene generation and robotic manipulation tasks.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18988,

However, previous methods cannot distinguish 3D instance-level information, which usually predicts a heatmap between the scene feature and text query. In this paper, we propose PanoGS, a novel and effective 3D panoptic open vocabulary scene understanding approach. Technically, to learn accurate 3D language features that can scale to large indoor scenarios, we adopt the pyramid tri-plane to model the latent continuous parametric feature space and use a 3D feature decoder to regress the multi-view fused 2D feature cloud. Besides, we propose language-guided graph cuts that synergistically leverage reconstructed geometry and learned language cues to group 3D Gaussian primitives into a set of super-primitives. To obtain 3D consistent instance, we perform graph clustering based segmentation with SAM-guided edge affinity computation between different super-primitives.

Indoor scenes mainly consist of man-made objects, such as furniture, which often exhibit rectilinear geometry. This property allows indoor scenes to be represented using combinations of polycuboids, providing a compact representation that benefits downstream applications like furniture rearrangement. Our framework takes a noisy point cloud as input and first detects six types of cuboid faces using a transformer network. Then, a graph neural network is used to validate the spatial relationships of the detected faces to form potential polycuboids. Finally, each polycuboid instance is reconstructed by forming a set of boxes based on the aggregated face labels. To train our networks, we introduce a synthetic dataset encompassing a diverse range of cuboid and polycuboid shapes that reflect the characteristics of indoor scenes. Our framework generalizes well to real-world indoor scene datasets, including Replica, ScanNet, and scenes captured with an iPhone.

On the other hand, most domain generalization or adversarial fine-tuning methods are task-related or model-specific, ignoring the universality in practical applications and the transferability between FMs. This paper delves into the problem of generalizing FMs to the out-of-domain data. We propose a novel framework, the Object-Concept-Relation Triad (OCRT), that enables FMs to extract sparse, high-level concepts and intricate relational structures from raw visual inputs. The key idea is to bind objects in visual scenes and a set of object-centric representations through unsupervised decoupling and iterative refinement. To be specific, we project the object-centric representations onto a semantic concept space that the model can readily interpret and estimate their importance to filter out irrelevant elements. Then, a concept-based graph, which has a flexible degree, is constructed to incorporate the set of concepts and their corresponding importance, enabling the extraction of high-order factors from informative concepts and facilitating relational reasoning among these concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCRT can substantially boost the generalizability and robustness of SAM and CLIP across multiple downstream tasks.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18695,

However, current approaches face limitations in effectively comprehending the complex evolutions of driving scenes over time. This paper proposes FM4SU, a novel methodology for training a symbolic foundation model (FM) for scene understanding in autonomous driving. It leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture sensory observation along with domain knowledge such as road topology, traffic rules, or complex interactions between traffic participants. A bird's eye view (BEV) symbolic representation is extracted from the KG for each driving scene, including the spatio-temporal information among the objects across the scenes. The BEV representation is serialized into a sequence of tokens and given to pre-trained language models (PLMs) for learning an inherent understanding of the co-occurrence among driving scene elements and generating predictions on the next scenes. We conducted a number of experiments using the nuScenes dataset and KG in various scenarios. The results demonstrate that fine-tuned models achieve significantly higher accuracy in all tasks.

Models designed to generate interleaved text and images face challenges in ensuring consistency within and across these modalities. To address these challenges, we present ISG, a comprehensive evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation. ISG leverages a scene graph structure to capture relationships between text and image blocks, evaluating responses on four levels of granularity: holistic, structural, block-level, and image-specific. This multi-tiered evaluation allows for a nuanced assessment of consistency, coherence, and accuracy, and provides interpretable question-answer feedback. In conjunction with ISG, we introduce a benchmark, ISG-Bench, encompassing 1,150 samples across 8 categories and 21 subcategories. This benchmark dataset includes complex language-vision dependencies and golden answers to evaluate models effectively on vision-centric tasks such as style transfer, a challenging area for current models. Using ISG-Bench, we demonstrate that recent unified vision-language models perform poorly on generating interleaved content. While compositional approaches that combine separate language and image models show a 111% improvement over unified models at the holistic level, their performance remains suboptimal at both block and image levels.

To address these limitations, we proposed a novel Context-Aware Semantic Segmentation framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with state-of-the-art vision backbones. Our hybrid model leverages the Swin Transformer for robust visual feature extraction and GPT-4 for enriching semantic understanding through text embeddings. A Cross-Attention Mechanism is introduced to align vision and language features, enabling the model to reason about context more effectively.

To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations.

The key insight of our methods is to establish implicit-semantic area matching prior to point matching, based on advanced image understanding of SAM. Then, informative area matches with consistent internal semantic are able to undergo dense feature comparison, facilitating precise inside-area point matching. Specifically, MESA adopts a sparse matching framework and first obtains candidate areas from SAM results through a novel Area Graph (AG). Then, area matching among the candidates is formulated as graph energy minimization and solved by graphical models derived from AG. To address the efficiency issue of MESA, we further propose DMESA as its dense counterpart, applying a dense matching framework. After candidate areas are identified by AG, DMESA establishes area matches through generating dense matching distributions.

Current SLAM approaches predominantly rely on geometric cues for mapping and localization, but they often fail to ensure semantic consistency, particularly in dynamic or densely populated scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce STAMICS, a novel method that integrates semantic information with 3D Gaussian representations to enhance both localization and mapping accuracy. STAMICS consists of three key components: a 3D Gaussian-based scene representation for high-fidelity reconstruction, a graph-based clustering technique that enforces temporal semantic consistency, and an open-vocabulary system that allows for the classification of unseen objects. Extensive experiments show that STAMICS significantly improves camera pose estimation and map quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while reducing reconstruction errors.

145,Scenario Dreamer: Vectorized Latent Diffusion for Generating Driving Simulation Environments,"Luke Rowe,Roger Girgis,Anthony Gosselin,Liam Paull,Christopher Pal,Felix Heide","We introduce Scenario Dreamer, a fully data-driven generative simulator for autonomous vehicle planning that generates both the initial traffic scene - comprising a lane graph and agent bounding boxes - and closed-loop agent behaviours. Existing methods for generating driving simulation environments encode the initial traffic scene as a rasterized image and, as such, require parameter-heavy networks that perform unnecessary computation due to many empty pixels in the rasterized scene. Moreover, we find that existing methods that employ rule-based agent behaviours lack diversity and realism. Scenario Dreamer instead employs a novel vectorized latent diffusion model for initial scene generation that directly operates on the vectorized scene elements and an autoregressive Transformer for data-driven agent behaviour simulation. Scenario Dreamer additionally supports scene extrapolation via diffusion inpainting, enabling the generation of unbounded simulation environments. Extensive experiments show that Scenario Dreamer outperforms existing generative simulators in realism and efficiency: the vectorized scene-generation base model achieves superior generation quality with around 2x fewer parameters, 6x lower generation latency, and 10x fewer GPU training hours compared to the strongest baseline. We confirm its practical utility by showing that reinforcement learning planning agents are more challenged in Scenario Dreamer environments than traditional non-generative simulation environments, especially on long and adversarial driving environments.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22496,
146,Computer Vision Datasets and Models Exhibit Cultural and Linguistic Diversity in Perception,"Andre Ye,Sebastin Santy,Jena D. Hwang,Amy X. Zhang,Ranjay Krishna","Computer vision often treats human perception as homogeneous: an implicit assumption that visual stimuli are perceived similarly by everyone. This assumption is reflected in the way researchers collect datasets and train vision models. By contrast, literature in cross-cultural psychology and linguistics has provided evidence that people from different cultural backgrounds observe vastly different concepts even when viewing the same visual stimuli. In this paper, we study how these differences manifest themselves in vision-language datasets and models, using language as a proxy for culture. By comparing textual descriptions generated across 7 languages for the same images, we find significant differences in the semantic content and linguistic expression. When datasets are multilingual as opposed to monolingual, descriptions have higher semantic coverage on average, where coverage is measured using scene graphs, model embeddings, and linguistic taxonomies. For example, multilingual descriptions have on average 29.9% more objects, 24.5% more relations, and 46.0% more attributes than a set of monolingual captions. When prompted to describe images in different languages, popular models (e.g. LLaVA) inherit this bias and describe different parts of the image. Moreover, finetuning models on captions from one language performs best on corresponding test data from that language, while finetuning on multilingual data performs consistently well across all test data compositions. Our work points towards the need to account for and embrace the diversity of human perception in the computer vision community.",October 2023.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14356,

It represents a scene with three key components: a program that specifies the hierarchical and relational structure of entities in the scene, words in natural language that summarize the semantic class of each entity, and embeddings that capture the visual identity of each entity. This representation can be inferred from pre-trained language models via a training-free inference technique, given text or image inputs. The resulting scene can be rendered into images using traditional, neural, or hybrid graphics renderers. Together, this forms a robust, automated system for high-quality 3D and 4D scene generation. Compared with existing representations like scene graphs, our proposed Scene Language generates complex scenes with higher fidelity, while explicitly modeling the scene structures to enable precise control and editing.",October 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16770,
148,Localized Graph-Based Neural Dynamics Models for Terrain Manipulation,"Chaoqi Liu,Yunzhu Li,Kris Hauser","Predictive models can be particularly helpful for robots to effectively manipulate terrains in construction sites and extraterrestrial surfaces. However, terrain state representations become extremely high-dimensional especially to capture fine-resolution details and when depth is unknown or unbounded. This paper introduces a learning-based approach for terrain dynamics modeling and manipulation, leveraging the Graph-based Neural Dynamics (GBND) framework to represent terrain deformation as motion of a graph of particles. Based on the principle that the moving portion of a terrain is usually localized, our approach builds a large terrain graph (potentially millions of particles) but only identifies a very small active subgraph (hundreds of particles) for predicting the outcomes of robot-terrain interaction. To minimize the size of the active subgraph we introduce a learning-based approach that identifies a small region of interest (RoI) based on the robot's control inputs and the current scene. We also introduce a novel domain boundary feature encoding that allows GBNDs to perform accurate dynamics prediction in the RoI interior while avoiding particle penetration through RoI boundaries. Our proposed method is both orders of magnitude faster than naive GBND and it achieves better overall prediction accuracy. We further evaluated our framework on excavation and shaping tasks on terrain with different granularity.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23270,
149,Semantic-Spatial Feature Fusion with Dynamic Graph Refinement for Remote Sensing Image Captioning,"Maofu Liu,Jiahui Liu,Xiaokang Zhang","Remote sensing image captioning aims to generate semantically accurate descriptions that are closely linked to the visual features of remote sensing images. Existing approaches typically emphasize fine-grained extraction of visual features and capturing global information. However, they often overlook the complementary role of textual information in enhancing visual semantics and face challenges in precisely locating objects that are most relevant to the image context. To address these challenges, this paper presents a semantic-spatial feature fusion with dynamic graph refinement (SFDR) method, which integrates the semantic-spatial feature fusion (SSFF) and dynamic graph feature refinement (DGFR) modules. The SSFF module utilizes a multi-level feature representation strategy by leveraging pre-trained CLIP features, grid features, and ROI features to integrate rich semantic and spatial information. In the DGFR module, a graph attention network captures the relationships between feature nodes, while a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes objects that are most relevant to the current scene and suppresses less significant ones. Therefore, the proposed SFDR method significantly enhances the quality of the generated descriptions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.",December 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00161,

State-of-the-art approaches to the problem leverage CLIP to extract visual-relevant textual prompts to guide language models in generating captions. These methods tend to focus on one key aspect of the scene and build a caption that ignores the rest of the visual input. To address this issue, and generate more accurate and complete captions, we propose a novel progressive multi-granularity textual prompting strategy for zero-shot video captioning. Our approach constructs three distinct memory banks, encompassing noun phrases, scene graphs of noun phrases, and entire sentences. Moreover, we introduce a category-aware retrieval mechanism that models the distribution of natural language surrounding the specific topics in question. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with 5.7%, 16.2%, and 3.4% improvements in terms of the main metric CIDEr on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX benchmarks compared to existing state-of-the-art.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23679,

To bridge this gap, Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) has emerged to capture multi-object relationships across video frames. However, prior methods rely on pairwise connections, limiting their ability to handle complex multi-object interactions and reasoning. To this end, we propose Multimodal LLMs on a Scene HyperGraph (HyperGLM), promoting reasoning about multi-way interactions and higher-order relationships. Our approach uniquely integrates entity scene graphs, which capture spatial relationships between objects, with a procedural graph that models their causal transitions, forming a unified HyperGraph. Significantly, HyperGLM enables reasoning by injecting this unified HyperGraph into LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a new Video Scene Graph Reasoning (VSGR) dataset featuring 1.9M frames from third-person, egocentric, and drone views and supports five tasks: Scene Graph Generation, Scene Graph Anticipation, Video Question Answering, Video Captioning, and Relation Reasoning. Empirically, HyperGLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five tasks, effectively modeling and reasoning complex relationships in diverse video scenes.",November 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18042,
153,Visual Environment-Interactive Planning for Embodied Complex-Question Answering,"Ning Lan,Baoshan Ou,Xuemei Xie,Guangming Shi","This study focuses on Embodied Complex-Question Answering task, which means the embodied robot need to understand human questions with intricate structures and abstract semantics. The core of this task lies in making appropriate plans based on the perception of the visual environment. Existing methods often generate plans in a once-for-all manner, i.e., one-step planning. Such approach rely on large models, without sufficient understanding of the environment. Considering multi-step planning, the framework for formulating plans in a sequential manner is proposed in this paper. To ensure the ability of our framework to tackle complex questions, we create a structured semantic space, where hierarchical visual perception and chain expression of the question essence can achieve iterative interaction. This space makes sequential task planning possible. Within the framework, we first parse human natural language based on a visual hierarchical scene graph, which can clarify the intention of the question. Then, we incorporate external rules to make a plan for current step, weakening the reliance on large models. Every plan is generated based on feedback from visual perception, with multiple rounds of interaction until an answer is obtained. This approach enables continuous feedback and adjustment, allowing the robot to optimize its action strategy. To test our framework, we contribute a new dataset with more complex questions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs excellently and stably on complex tasks. And also, the feasibility of our approach in real-world scenarios has been established, indicating its practical applicability.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00775,https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2025.3538860

This facilitates image-based understanding and reasoning for various downstream tasks. Although fully supervised SGG approaches showed steady performance improvements, they suffer from a severe training bias. This is caused by the availability of only small subsets of curated data and exhibits long-tail predicate distribution issues with a lack of predicate diversity adversely affecting downstream tasks. To overcome this, we introduce PRISM-0, a framework for zero-shot open-vocabulary SGG that bootstraps foundation models in a bottom-up approach to capture the whole spectrum of diverse, open-vocabulary predicate prediction. Detected object pairs are filtered and passed to a Vision Language Model (VLM) that generates descriptive captions. These are used to prompt an LLM to generate fine-andcoarse-grained predicates for the pair. The predicates are then validated using a VQA model to provide a final SGG. With the modular and dataset-independent PRISM-0, we can enrich existing SG datasets such as Visual Genome (VG). Experiments illustrate that PRIMS-0 generates semantically meaningful graphs that improve downstream tasks such as Image Captioning and Sentence-to-Graph Retrieval with a performance on par to the best fully supervised methods.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00844,
155,DELTA: Decomposed Efficient Long-Term Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models,"Yuchen Liu,Luigi Palmieri,Sebastian Koch,Ilche Georgievski,Marco Aiello","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a revolution across many research fields. In robotics, the integration of common-sense knowledge from LLMs into task and motion planning has drastically advanced the field by unlocking unprecedented levels of context awareness. Despite their vast collection of knowledge, large language models may generate infeasible plans due to hallucinations or missing domain information. To address these challenges and improve plan feasibility and computational efficiency, we introduce DELTA, a novel LLM-informed task planning approach. By using scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, DELTA achieves rapid generation of precise planning problem descriptions. To enhance planning performance, DELTA decomposes long-term task goals with LLMs into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals, enabling automated task planners to efficiently solve complex problems. In our extensive evaluation, we show that DELTA enables an efficient and fully automatic task planning pipeline, achieving higher planning success rates and significantly shorter planning times compared to the state of the art.

Our work aims to enable home robots who respond to emergency scenarios in the home, preventing injuries and deaths. We introduce a new dataset of household emergencies based in the ThreeDWorld simulator. Each scenario in our dataset begins with an instantaneous or periodic sound which may or may not be an emergency. The agent must navigate the multi-room home scene using prior observations, alongside audio signals and images from the simulator, to determine if there is an emergency or not.  In addition to our new dataset, we present a modular approach for localizing and identifying potential home emergencies. Underpinning our approach is a novel probabilistic dynamic scene graph (P-DSG), where our key insight is that graph nodes corresponding to agents can be represented with a probabilistic edge. This edge, when refined using Bayesian inference, enables efficient and effective localization of agents in the scene. We also utilize multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs) as a component in our approach, determining object traits (e.g. flammability) and identifying emergencies.

However, recent approaches to language-guided 3D scene editing either require manual interventions or focus only on appearance modifications without supporting comprehensive scene layout changes. In response, we propose EditRoom, a unified framework capable of executing a variety of layout edits through natural language commands, without requiring manual intervention. Specifically, EditRoom leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for command planning and generates target scenes using a diffusion-based method, enabling six types of edits: rotate, translate, scale, replace, add, and remove. To address the lack of data for language-guided 3D scene editing, we have developed an automatic pipeline to augment existing 3D scene synthesis datasets and introduced EditRoom-DB, a large-scale dataset with 83k editing pairs, for training and evaluation.

158,Gen-C: Populating Virtual Worlds with Generative Crowds,"Andreas Panayiotou,Panayiotis Charalambous,Ioannis Karamouzas","Over the past two decades, researchers have made significant advancements in simulating human crowds, yet these efforts largely focus on low-level tasks like collision avoidance and a narrow range of behaviors such as path following and flocking. However, creating compelling crowd scenes demands more than just functional movement-it requires capturing high-level interactions between agents, their environment, and each other over time. To address this issue, we introduce Gen-C, a generative model to automate the task of authoring high-level crowd behaviors. Gen-C bypasses the labor-intensive and challenging task of collecting and annotating real crowd video data by leveraging a large language model (LLM) to generate a limited set of crowd scenarios, which are subsequently expanded and generalized through simulations to construct time-expanded graphs that model the actions and interactions of virtual agents. Our method employs two Variational Graph Auto-Encoders guided by a condition prior network: one dedicated to learning a latent space for graph structures (agent interactions) and the other for node features (agent actions and navigation). This setup enables the flexible generation of dynamic crowd interactions. The trained model can be conditioned on natural language, empowering users to synthesize novel crowd behaviors from text descriptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two scenarios, a University Campus and a Train Station, showcasing its potential for populating diverse virtual environments with agents exhibiting varied and dynamic behaviors that reflect complex interactions and high-level decision-making patterns.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01924,

Many applications in AD systems necessitate high-quality training datasets using both existing datasets and newly collected data. In this paper, we propose a traffic scene joint active learning (TSceneJAL) framework that can efficiently sample the balanced, diverse, and complex traffic scenes from both labeled and unlabeled data. The novelty of this framework is threefold: 1) a scene sampling scheme based on a category entropy, to identify scenes containing multiple object classes, thus mitigating class imbalance for the active learner; 2) a similarity sampling scheme, estimated through the directed graph representation and a marginalize kernel algorithm, to pick sparse and diverse scenes; 3) an uncertainty sampling scheme, predicted by a mixture density network, to select instances with the most unclear or complex regression outcomes for the learner. Finally, the integration of these three schemes in a joint selection strategy yields an optimal and valuable subdataset.

These advances do not translate directly to performance in the physical 3D world, where they often over-segment objects and fail to produce consistent mask correspondences across views. In this paper, we present GraphSeg, a framework for generating consistent 3D object segmentations from a sparse set of 2D images of the environment without any depth information. GraphSeg adds edges to graphs and constructs dual correspondence graphs: one from 2D pixel-level similarities and one from inferred 3D structure. We formulate segmentation as a problem of edge addition, then subsequent graph contraction, which merges multiple 2D masks into unified object-level segmentations. We can then leverage \\emph{3D foundation models} to produce segmented 3D representations.

Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information.

To address grounding issues of such models, it has been suggested to split the pipeline into perceptional state grounding and subsequent state-based planning.

To address this shortcoming, we develop a more structured state grounding framework that features a domain-conditioned scene graph as its scene representation. We show that such representation is actionable in nature as it is directly mappable to a symbolic state in classical planning languages such as PDDL. We provide an instantiation of our state grounding framework where the domain-conditioned scene graph generation is implemented with a lightweight vision-language approach that classifies domain-specific predicates on top of domain-relevant object detections. Evaluated across three domains, our approach achieves significantly higher state estimation accuracy and task planning success rates compared to the previous LMM-based approaches.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06661,
169,TextPSG: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation from Textual Descriptions,"Chengyang Zhao,Yikang Shen,Zhenfang Chen,Mingyu Ding,Chuang Gan","Panoptic Scene Graph has recently been proposed for comprehensive scene understanding. However, previous works adopt a fully-supervised learning manner, requiring large amounts of pixel-wise densely-annotated data, which is always tedious and expensive to obtain. To address this limitation, we study a new problem of Panoptic Scene Graph Generation from Purely Textual Descriptions (Caption-to-PSG). The key idea is to leverage the large collection of free image-caption data on the Web alone to generate panoptic scene graphs. The problem is very challenging for three constraints: 1) no location priors; 2) no explicit links between visual regions and textual entities; and 3) no pre-defined concept sets. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework TextPSG consisting of four modules, i.e., a region grouper, an entity grounder, a segment merger, and a label generator, with several novel techniques. The region grouper first groups image pixels into different segments and the entity grounder then aligns visual segments with language entities based on the textual description of the segment being referred to. The grounding results can thus serve as pseudo labels enabling the segment merger to learn the segment similarity as well as guiding the label generator to learn object semantics and relation predicates, resulting in a fine-grained structured scene understanding. Our framework is effective, significantly outperforming the baselines and achieving strong out-of-distribution robustness. We perform comprehensive ablation studies to corroborate the effectiveness of our design choices and provide an in-depth analysis to highlight future directions.

170,SAMJAM: Zero-Shot Video Scene Graph Generation for Egocentric Kitchen Videos,"Joshua Li,Fernando Jose Pena Cantu,Emily Yu,Alexander Wong,Yuchen Cui,Yuhao Chen","Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) is an important topic in understanding dynamic kitchen environments. Current models for VidSGG require extensive training to produce scene graphs. Recently, Vision Language Models (VLM) and Vision Foundation Models (VFM) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities in a variety of tasks. However, VLMs like Gemini struggle with the dynamics for VidSGG, failing to maintain stable object identities across frames. To overcome this limitation, we propose SAMJAM, a zero-shot pipeline that combines SAM2's temporal tracking with Gemini's semantic understanding. SAM2 also improves upon Gemini's object grounding by producing more accurate bounding boxes. In our method, we first prompt Gemini to generate a frame-level scene graph. Then, we employ a matching algorithm to map each object in the scene graph with a SAM2-generated or SAM2-propagated mask, producing a temporally-consistent scene graph in dynamic environments. Finally, we repeat this process again in each of the following frames. We empirically demonstrate that SAMJAM outperforms Gemini by 8.33% in mean recall on the EPIC-KITCHENS and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07867,
171,R-SCoRe: Revisiting Scene Coordinate Regression for Robust Large-Scale Visual Localization,"Xudong Jiang,Fangjinhua Wang,Silvano Galliani,Christoph Vogel,Marc Pollefeys","Learning-based visual localization methods that use scene coordinate regression (SCR) offer the advantage of smaller map sizes. However, on datasets with complex illumination changes or image-level ambiguities, it remains a less robust alternative to feature matching methods. This work aims to close the gap. We introduce a covisibility graph-based global encoding learning and data augmentation strategy, along with a depth-adjusted reprojection loss to facilitate implicit triangulation. Additionally, we revisit the network architecture and local feature extraction module. Our method achieves state-of-the-art on challenging large-scale datasets without relying on network ensembles or 3D supervision. On Aachen Day-Night, we are 10$\\times$ more accurate than previous SCR methods with similar map sizes and require at least 5$\\times$ smaller map sizes than any other SCR method while still delivering superior accuracy.

172,Conformal Prediction and MLLM aided Uncertainty Quantification in Scene Graph Generation,"Sayak Nag,Udita Ghosh,Calvin-Khang Ta,Sarosij Bose,Jiachen Li,Amit K Roy Chowdhury","Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to represent visual scenes by identifying objects and their pairwise relationships, providing a structured understanding of image content. However, inherent challenges like long-tailed class distributions and prediction variability necessitate uncertainty quantification in SGG for its practical viability. In this paper, we introduce a novel Conformal Prediction (CP) based framework, adaptive to any existing SGG method, for quantifying their predictive uncertainty by constructing well-calibrated prediction sets over their generated scene graphs. These scene graph prediction sets are designed to achieve statistically rigorous coverage guarantees. Additionally, to ensure these prediction sets contain the most practically interpretable scene graphs, we design an effective MLLM-based post-processing strategy for selecting the most visually and semantically plausible scene graphs within these prediction sets. We show that our proposed approach can produce diverse possible scene graphs from an image, assess the reliability of SGG methods, and improve overall SGG performance.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13947,
173,DSM: Building A Diverse Semantic Map for 3D Visual Grounding,"Qinghongbing Xie,Zijian Liang,Long Zeng","In recent years, with the growing research and application of multimodal large language models (VLMs) in robotics, there has been an increasing trend of utilizing VLMs for robotic scene understanding tasks. Existing approaches that use VLMs for 3D Visual Grounding tasks often focus on obtaining scene information through geometric and visual information, overlooking the extraction of diverse semantic information from the scene and the understanding of rich implicit semantic attributes, such as appearance, physics, and affordance. The 3D scene graph, which combines geometry and language, is an ideal representation method for environmental perception and is an effective carrier for language models in 3D Visual Grounding tasks. To address these issues, we propose a diverse semantic map construction method specifically designed for robotic agents performing 3D Visual Grounding tasks. This method leverages VLMs to capture the latent semantic attributes and relations of objects within the scene and creates a Diverse Semantic Map (DSM) through a geometry sliding-window map construction strategy. We enhance the understanding of grounding information based on DSM and introduce a novel approach named DSM-Grounding. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current approaches in tasks like semantic segmentation and 3D Visual Grounding, particularly excelling in overall metrics compared to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we have deployed this method on robots to validate its effectiveness in navigation and grasping tasks.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08307,
174,ASHiTA: Automatic Scene-grounded HIerarchical Task Analysis,"Yun Chang,Leonor Fermoselle,Duy Ta,Bernadette Bucher,Luca Carlone,Jiuguang Wang","While recent work in scene reconstruction and understanding has made strides in grounding natural language to physical 3D environments, it is still challenging to ground abstract, high-level instructions to a 3D scene. High-level instructions might not explicitly invoke semantic elements in the scene, and even the process of breaking a high-level task into a set of more concrete subtasks, a process called hierarchical task analysis, is environment-dependent. In this work, we propose ASHiTA, the first framework that generates a task hierarchy grounded to a 3D scene graph by breaking down high-level tasks into grounded subtasks. ASHiTA alternates LLM-assisted hierarchical task analysis, to generate the task breakdown, with task-driven 3D scene graph construction to generate a suitable representation of the environment. Our experiments show that ASHiTA performs significantly better than LLM baselines in breaking down high-level tasks into environment-dependent subtasks and is additionally able to achieve grounding performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06553,
